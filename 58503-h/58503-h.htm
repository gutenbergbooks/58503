<p>In all times of stress and struggle, it is not from our
friends and supporters, but from our enemies and
opponents, that we receive the best and most practical
instruction. If an evil or a peril exist, it is surely best
to know it; and if serious treason be hatching in dark
places, publicity may easily rob it of its main strength
and neutralise its virulence. Further, in order to rightly
understand racial conflicts&mdash;of all the most bitter&mdash;we
must put ourselves in our adversary’s place in order
to arrive at just conclusions. We are quite aware that
in issuing this uncompromising attack upon British
supremacy in South Africa the writer is viewing everything
from an entirely anti-English standpoint, but surely
it is of great practical importance that we should be accurately
informed as to the way in which our adversaries
regard us. More practical instruction can be obtained
thus than in any other manner. The intense hostility of
the writer to England is manifest, and a perusal of these
pages is calculated to be of real service to those to whom,
as to ourselves, the solidarity and permanence of the
British Empire is a primary consideration.

<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">To the Reader</span>,</p>

<p>Gentle Reader, I have written this
story in the English language&mdash;a language learned by me,
as a foreign language, for the chief purpose of placing
before the English reading public a true and faithful
version of the character and life of an Afrikander. So
many libels and false stories have of late been spread
in England and all over the world about the Boers by
enemies of the people inhabiting the Colonies and States
of South Africa, that I could not resist the temptation
to write something in which the truth and nothing but
the truth would be told. I have made the attempt;
whether it is to be successful or not, the reading public
must decide.</p>

<p>In this story there is no plot (excepting the Great
Complot). It is simply a story of everyday life, with
little or no embellishment. Yet I trust the reader, in
lands far away as well as those living here in my own
beloved native land, will find sufficient to interest him
to lead him on to the end of the book. At the least,
there was subject-matter enough to write about without
going out of the paths of Truth. My only difficulty was
not to be led away by my subject and make this work
too large for a first attempt in literature.</p>

<p>The incidents and adventures related, as well as anecdotes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
by old Burghers of the South African Republic,
are all based upon truth, and were learned by the writer
from the parties themselves. The sad death by lightning
of poor Daniel is true, word for word, even to the premonition
he had of his death, and occurred only as late
as the beginning of this year (1896); and many will
recognise the family as described by the writer.</p>

<p>The writer has mostly made use of Christian names,
as all the characters used in this story are real and living;
and it would serve no purpose to publish real
names, while substituted names would only be misleading.
Where politics have been drawn into the story,
the reader may rely upon the truth only having been
told of events, as well as prevailing opinions as expressed
by representatives of the different parties. The latter
part of the book is largely devoted to the events of the
New Year (1896) which occurred near Krugersdorp,
Johannesburg and Pretoria, and its results as gathered
by one who took note of everything on the spot, and
may be relied upon as being true in every detail. If I
have succeeded in convincing a portion of the public of
the truth, I shall rest well satisfied.</p>

<span class="medium">A DEATH-BED SCENE</span></h3>

<p>A death-bed is always a sad scene, but doubly so when it
is that of a parent surrounded by his or her children, and
trebly so when those children are young and helpless.</p>

<p>Let me introduce the reader to such a scene for a
moment, for ’tis good now and again to be drawn near
to death, if only for a moment, for it brings us face to
face with the fleeting and uncertain nature of life, and
admonishes us to be prepared.</p>

<p>Behold, then, a pale weak figure, in a white draped,
old-fashioned, four-post bed; that figure is the figure
of a dying man, that man the father of three children,
a boy and two girls, who are standing around the bed
clinging to their mother.</p>

<p>‘But if father is going away, where is he going to,
mother?’ said the boy, the eldest of the three. Alas! he
did not realise what was taking place. He had been told
that his father was going away; but he could not realise
that he would see him no more on earth, and that he
would be left alone to fight the battle of life, with only a
poor, poverty-stricken mother to stand between him and
starvation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>‘Dear Stephen, he is going to heaven. God has called
him and he must go.’</p>

<p>‘But may we not go with him, mother?’</p>

<p>‘No, my child, we may not go till God calls us.’</p>

<p>‘But when will He call us, mother?’</p>

<p>‘I do not know, dear; we must be prepared to go whenever
He calls; it may be to-morrow, or it may not be
for years.’</p>

<p>‘But when shall we see father again, mother?’</p>

<p>‘When God calls us to heaven, too, dear.’</p>

<p>‘Come near, Stephen,’ his father called to him in weak
and trembling tones. ‘Steve, my son, I want to say a few
words to you before I leave you. First I want you to
take care of your mother and sisters as much as you can.
Your mother will be weak and unprotected, and when you
are grown up, you must work and support her and your
sisters as best you can. Then I want you to promise to
always fear God and look to Him for aid in time of need,
and serve Him to the best of your ability in time of prosperity.
And lastly, I want you always to be faithful to your
country and your people. Remember that here we are
a vassal race as yet. But thank God there are two bright
spots in South Africa where our people are free, and
acknowledge only one King&mdash;God&mdash;the King of kings.
And if ever the time should come that you may be able
to aid in bringing our people nearer to being a one and
united people&mdash;free&mdash;under God’s guidance, do your
best. Do you promise?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, father, I will do my best.’</p>

<p>‘I know, child, you can hardly understand these things
yet, but when you are older you will understand what
I mean. Your mother will write my request down for
you, and when you are grown up and are a man, you will
understand. Now kiss me all of you. May God bless
you and be a father to you all. Amen.’

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="medium">BOYHOOD</span></h3>

<p>Seven years have passed, our young hero has grown considerably.
He is now twelve years of age. Behold him
once more. He is kneeling near to his mother and sisters.
The mother is praying. ‘Oh, God,’ she prays,‘have
mercy on our dear people. Oh, Jesus, they are of our
blood and our race, and they have done no wrong as a
people. Oh, Christ, they have fled into the wilderness to
worship Thee in quiet and in peace. Oh, God, they have
done naught but they have done it in Thy name. Oh, Lord,
they have struggled against famine and troubles untold.
Oh, Jesus, they have bled and fought against the heathen
and Thou hast always succoured them. When death
faced them Thou saved them and said, “Live, and be a
<i>people</i>.” Oh, God, Thou wilt surely not desert them now.
Lord aid, even though victory seems impossible to human
minds. Thou art the God of battles, and to Thee all
things are possible. Oh, Lord, in Thee do we and they
trust, now and evermore. Amen.’</p>

<p>They rise, and Steve goes up to his mother and stands
leaning fondly against her.</p>

<p>It is January 1881. It is the time of the Transvaal
struggle for independence and freedom.</p>

<p>Daily alarming telegrams arrive, and tear the hearts
of relatives and friends of the poor struggling immigrants
in the Transvaal. The killed and wounded of the Boers
are always given in hundreds. We <i>now</i> know how lying
these telegrams were. But the friends of the Boers did
not then know what was true or not.</p>

<p>Steve nestled near to his mother and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘But, mother, cannot we go and help our people in the
Transvaal? Surely it is not so far away but we can reach
them, and fight by their side? And,’ drawing himself up
to his full height, ‘if needs be, we can die with them.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>‘My dear, you are far too young to talk about fighting
and dying in battle; but it is impossible, even if you
were old enough, to do so. There is many and many
a heart here that beats in unison with our race, fighting
for freedom in the Transvaal, and would gladly take up
arms for them. But, alas, we are bound hand and foot,
and are surrounded by the enemy. We cannot leave
here a day’s march, but the English Goverment will stop
our people from going to help their friends in the Transvaal.
We are surrounded by enemies. No, child, we
can only pray and trust in God.’</p>

<p>‘And will God help them if we pray for them,
mother?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, child, for their cause is just, and God always
helps in a righteous cause.’</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="medium">A CONTROVERSY</span></h3>

<p>‘Steve, you are talking nonsense.’</p>

<p>A group of boys were standing talking, warmly arguing
about the all-absorbing topic of the day&mdash;the
Transvaal war.</p>

<p>‘I should like to know why I talk nonsense more than
you?’</p>

<p>‘Why, you say that the Transvaal Boers can fight
against England and win. I should like to know how
a few Boers can fight against England, when we have
already more soldiers on the Transvaal border than there
are Boers to fight, and there are as many more coming out
from England, with ever so many cannon. And
when these arrive, what will your Boers do then? You
are talking nonsense, I say!’</p>

<p>‘I am not talking nonsense, for mother says that, if
we pray to God to help our people, He will surely do so,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
and then they will win; for God is stronger than England
and all the world besides.’</p>

<p>Steve’s opponent smiled derisively, as if he thought
Steve was talking nonsense worse than ever&mdash;as if people
could swallow such childish superstitions in the latter end
of the nineteenth century, that God fights the battles of
nations; these things are too antiquated! But, thought
he to himself, I might as well fight it out with him on
his own ground, and with his own weapons, so he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘But, Steve, the English people will also pray; and
why do you think God would answer your people’s
prayers more than the prayers of the English?’</p>

<p>‘Because God only answers our prayers when we
pray for a righteous thing; and our people’s cause is
righteous; the cause of the English is unrighteous, for
they seek to oppress a weaker people than themselves,
who have done them no harm.’</p>

<p>Steve’s simple faith in his mother’s teachings and in
the promises of his God, had given him the victory in
this schoolboy controversy. His opponent could only
smile in a depreciating sort of way and walk off.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="medium">INDEPENDENCE GAINED ONCE MORE&mdash;YOUTHFUL
PATRIOTISM</span></h3>

<p>Those were anxious times for all true South Africans&mdash;the
time of the Transvaal war of independence. At
first, nothing but cooked telegrams came, which made
out that the Boers wherever met were being defeated.
But later the truth leaked out, as it is ever bound to do,
viz., that the Boers were wondrously victorious in
every battle that had been fought. The accounts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Bronkorstspruit, Laingsnek and Schuimhoogte were
received with mixed feelings in the town of G&mdash;&mdash;n, in
the Cape Colony, where Steve and his mother lived.
Mixed, in that they were received by all Afrikanders and
Republicans with joy and thanksgivings to Him, to
Whom alone they ascribed the victory of their brethren;
but with anger and almost with unbelief by the Imperialists.
<i>They</i> could not believe it, for how was it
possible for those cowardly (?) Boers (who, it had been
predicted, would run away at the first cannon shot),
to defeat the thoroughly armed and disciplined troops
of England, why it is impossible! <i>They</i> believed that
such simple faith as Steve’s <i>was</i> childishness. But
what was their consternation when the disastrous news&mdash;to
them&mdash;of Amajuba came, capped by the tidings
that peace had been concluded favourably to the Boers.
They called shame on England for at last recognising
the injustice that they were perpetrating on a quiet and
peace-loving people.</p>

<p>Public opinion in England, and all over the world,
had shown the Imperial Government the error of their
ways at last. They had to make peace after being
defeated, and promise the Boers their independence
back again. But the Imperial Government seemed to
say, ‘Never mind the defeat and shame, we will show
the Boers a trick or two yet. We will appoint a Royal
Commission, and force a convention on the Boers to
our own liking, and they shall feel the Lion’s paw in
another way.’</p>

<p>Yes, England was magnanimous (?) enough to <i>give</i>
(?) the Boers their independence back, but not the
independence that had been taken from them.</p>

<p>Oh, no, English diplomats are not such fools! They
took gold from the Boers; they gave them brass in
exchange. They took their independence, independence
in every sense of the word, from them; independence
without conditions, such as was recognised by the Sand
River Convention, but they gave back a false municipal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
independence, only a shadow of the independence
possessed before.</p>

<p>‘Bah!’ thought these English diplomats, ‘how will
these ignorant Boers know the difference?’ Alas,
England, England, where was thy boasted <i>honour</i> and
magnanimity then? Thou protector of the weak and
injured, remember there <i>is</i> a God, Who weighs the
nations, as well as individuals; and the time may arrive,
when thou mayest see that dread hand-writing on the wall
with those fatal words, ‘Mene, mene, Tekel, Upharsin,&mdash;Thou
hast been weighed, and thou hast been found
wanting, and thou shalt be swept from off the face of the
earth. <i>Stop</i>&mdash;before it is too late, and use the power and
wealth that God has granted thee, to a better purpose
than that of enslaving and oppressing a weaker people.’</p>

<p>’Twas a glad day for Steve when he stopped before
the notice board of the local paper one day and read
the news of the Transvaal victory at Amajuba, and that
peace and freedom were promised to the people of his
father. He ran joyfully to his mother and cried out,
‘Mother, mother, God has heard our prayers, the
Transvaal has won, and our people are <i>Free</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Is that true, my son?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, mother, I have just seen it on the notice board,’
and then Steve told her all he had read on the board.</p>

<p>His mother, God-fearing and grateful, made him
kneel at her side, and poured out praises and thanksgivings
to God Almighty, Who had thus wrought a
miracle to save His people.</p>

<p>Does England realise that the Boers are a God-fearing
people, who have never heard of materialism, Atheism
and other blaspheming <i>isms</i>? still less do they believe in
such. No, they believe simply, and with the faith of a
child in God and His word:&mdash;‘If your faith is no larger
than a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say to that mountain
“<i>Go</i>,” and it <i>shall</i> go, “<i>Come</i>,” and it shall come.’
The Boers had <i>faith</i>, and they moved not mountains,
but they moved&mdash;England.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>While the war was still going on, and the ultimate end
of the war was yet uncertain, Steve, to show his patriotism,
and to prove that he was not ashamed to be called a
Boer (which name was generally used by the English as
a name of contempt and reproach), got up an association
amongst all his young Afrikander friends. In this association
there was only one rule, and this rule was, that no
member was to speak to another member without using
as a name of endearment the name ‘<i>Boer</i>.’ Each one
was to be honoured when addressed by another member
by being called ‘Boer’; and for some time the English
schoolmates of these young patriots were surprised to
hear remarks such as these, ‘Hillo, “Boer,” are you going
for a swim this afternoon,’ or, ‘I say, “Boer,” let us go
and have a feed of grapes at Tante (auntie) Sannie this
evening.’ And even to this day, when these young men
are grown up and are scattered over the country, when
corresponding with each other, they are in the habit of
beginning their letters in this way,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘My dear old Boer. I received your last letter,’ etc., and
they have lived to see the name of Boers not only not to
signify shame any longer, but to be honoured by friends
and foes.</p>

<p>Steve was over jealous of the good name of his people,
and lost no opportunity to stand up for them.</p>

<p>Our young hero had one staunch English friend, that
is English in that his parents were English, but he was
Afrikander born, and he was an Afrikander at heart. He
was named Gus Turner. These two young friends were
standing together amongst a group of other boys one day
arguing on politics as usual. Why shouldn’t they?&mdash;their
parents talked nothing else all day.</p>

<p>A young man named Jim M’Murphy was speaking
sneeringly. He was strongly built, and considerably
larger than Steve. He was saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘It is all humbug these Boers having beaten our
soldiers. They are all cowards!’</p>

<p>‘You lie!’ cried Steve in his anger; and before he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
knew what was going to take place, he was sprawling on
the ground, with a bloody nose from an unexpected
blow. But Steve was not the boy to accept punishment
unreturned, so he jumped up and hit his assailant on
the eye, which spoilt the sight of that eye for a day or
two.</p>

<p>‘Well done, Steve,’ cried Gus; ‘do it again.’</p>

<p>But he had no time to do it again, for at that moment
one of the teachers appeared on the scene and put a
stop to further fighting. But M’Murphy had not done
with him yet; a black eye was not to be taken tamely by
an Englishman from a Boer!</p>

<p>That night, when Steve went home from the evening
preparation class at school, he was surprised to see a
crowd of street arabs outside the school door. These
youngsters were composed of Kaffirs, Hottentots, and
bastards of all colours. To explain their presence, we
must state that M’Murphy’s father kept a grocery store;
among other good things, he retailed sugar sticks.
Jim M’Murphy was his fathers’ assistant when not in
school, and thus had full access to his father’s stock of
sugar sticks, and he used these sugar sticks as payment
to his regiment of young ragamuffins, who were to assist
him in having his revenge on Steve for the black eye
given him. What he really intended doing with Steve,
when he had captured him, has never been revealed;
but as soon as Steve had walked a few paces from the
school door, pushing his way through the crowd with the
assistance of Gus Turner, and wondering what in the
world was up to call such a crowd together, he felt
his jacket pulled violently from behind and heard
M’Murphy’s voice calling out,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Here he is.’ In a moment two or three more had
hold of him before he knew any evil was intended him.
But when he saw how the wind lay, he wrenched his
arms free and struck out right and left, always seconded
by Gus Turner, who stuck to his friend like a man.
But although Steve’s arms were now free, M’Murphy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
still had hold of his jacket, and he could not reach
behind himself to strike at the coward behind his back.
But he was not at a loss yet. He spun round and
round as fast as he could, and here was M’Murphy
revolving round him, standing straight out behind
Steve’s back, somewhat like the snake that had hold of
Paddy’s clothing when Paddy was running round the
house.</p>

<p>Going round at the speed that Steve was spinning,
even M’Murphy had to let go! and the sudden cessation
from his circular motion caused him to lose his balance,
and sent him squirming on the ground. M’Murphy’s
army was now closing up to take Steve and his companion
prisoners by force of numbers, when the teacher
once more appeared on the scene, being attracted by the
noise, and scattered M’Murphy’s army (like chaff before
the wind) with his great knobby stick.</p>

<p>Steve and Gus took advantage of this diversion in
their favour to clear round the first corner, but soon
found the whole crowd on their track once more. There
was nothing for it now but to run to avoid being captured.
But the enemy could run too, and half-a-dozen of the
best runners amongst the enemy were soon overtaking
the two fugitives. The foremost one was just laying
hold of Steve’s coat, when Gus Turner dropped down
right in front of him, tripped him, and sent him head
over heels to the ground, and two more of the enemy,
being just behind, followed suit. But Gus was up
again in a moment, and once more he and Steve ran
for it. Gaining a good few paces by the confusion
caused by the tripped enemy, Gus Turner’s home, which
was the nearest, was soon reached. Once protected by
the shadow of his castle, and sure of a safe retreat, the
two fugitives stood at bay, and taking out their catapults,
a boy’s most offensive weapon, sent a shower of buckshot
into the ranks of the approaching enemy, who first
halted in a crowd at a short distance, but finding themselves
thus bombarded by the hidden battery of the two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
boys standing in the dark shadow, the enemy soon
scattered and dispersed, leaving Gus and Steve in possession
of the battlefield.</p>

<span class="medium">YOUTHFUL PRANKS</span></h3>

<p>It is not our purpose to give a full history of the boyhood
of our hero. We would rather hurry on to give an
account of his life as a man. But we hope our readers
will not think it tedious, if we give an episode or two of
his boyhood’s life, which will enable the reader the better
to understand and sympathise with him in his aspirations
and ambitions.</p>

<p>Steve was by no means a paragon of goodness at all
times&mdash;no boy ever is. He loved mischief as much as
any other boy. We do not believe in the perfect hero.
Every boy and man, as well as girl and woman, has his
or her faults. Steve’s greatest fault was a keen sense of
the ludicrous, which often led him into mischief;
besides he loved mischief for its own sweet sake. He,
one night, nearly had to sleep in the lock-up through
his mischievous pranks. He and a companion, thinking
it a pity not to make the best use of a fine moonlight
night, proceeded to prepare for a game of <i>snake</i>.
To the reader, who has never had the pleasure and
excitement to play snake, I will explain how it is done.</p>

<p>A dark coloured strip of cloth is obtained in the shape
and size of a fine large healthy snake. To one end of
this artificial snake the end of a thin and almost invisible
string is tied. The longer the string the safer
the operation is.</p>

<p>Well, Steve and his companion manufactured just such
a snake. They laid the snake on one side of the street
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
in the regulation way. That is in the shape a snake is
supposed to delight in assuming, viz., curled up in a
zigzag form. Then they took the further end of the
string to the opposite side of the street, crept through a
hole in the hedge, taking their end of the string with
them, and watched their opportunity. Presently a man
came down the street, walking jauntily along as if he
feared neither man nor devil; but as soon as he is in a
line with the snake the fun commences. The first thing
our peaceful citizen is aware of is a snake entangled
with, and curling between, his legs, in a most lively
fashion (operated by the string of course). Who is
going to fight a snake of such a size in the uncertain
moonlight, and unarmed too? Not he! no fear! So
the only result was a yell, a whoop, and a mighty jump,
and our peaceful citizen disappears round the first
corner with long record-beating strides, leaving the
destruction of the snake to the next comer. Of course,
as soon as the victim is out of earshot, Steve and his
companion are holding their sides, laughing at the jolly
fun. The snake is soon replaced and the fun recommences.
After sundry victims had afforded copious fun
to the mischievous operators, they began to think it
rather slow waiting for customers, so they started walking
up the street in search of the slow-coming victims.
The fun was lively and brisk for some time, but they
reached the summit of their enjoyment when they
frightened a troop of servant girls, accompanied by
their beaux, out for a walk. The troop scattered all
over the street, howling, yelling and screaming, fit to
wake the dead. They did wake someone from his
sleep, who was not quite dead yet&mdash;the night watchman.
Now this night watchman was not a bird to be
caught by chaff twice. <i>He</i> had seen this trick before.
He caught up the snake, and, following the line up, soon
came to the hiding youths. But if he thought that he was
going to gain promotion by catching these night-birds he
was mightily mistaken, for these slippery gents crushed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
their way through the hedge lining the street into a
garden, and climbing hedge after hedge, from one
garden into the other, until they came to another street,
easily escaped, and walked quietly home, minus their
snake, which had fallen into the hands of the watchman.
Of course this spice of danger made the fun all the
greater.</p>

<p>Steve and his friends had one grand playground. It
was on the edge of the town on the river bank. There
they would congregate of an afternoon and indulge in
all the different kinds of games dear to a boy’s heart.
Steve was one of the youngest of the boys who met here,
and therefore was not as yet initiated into all the crafts
of the band. One night, while playing cricket at this
spot, Steve’s cousin and namesake&mdash;a boy easily led
astray and into mischief, vacillating and weak principled,
of which more will be seen further on&mdash;came to him,
and, after leading him on one side, said in English
(which, the reader must understand, is a foreign language
to Steve, his mother’s tongue being Dutch, or
rather Afrikander, and he was only just beginning to
learn English at school).</p>

<p>‘I say, Steve, do you want to smoke?’</p>

<p>‘Smoke? Smoke? What is that?’</p>

<p>‘Rook, rook!’ replied his cousin.</p>

<p>‘Oh, rook! I don’t know. Is it nice?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes; come and try.’</p>

<p>Of course the policy of his elder companions in asking
Steve to join them was to make him participate
in their stealthy practice, and thus incriminate him,
to prevent him from getting them into trouble by
telling anyone about it, by which means their parents
might come to hear of it, which, of course, would mean
severe punishment to them. Steve’s cousin led him
into a dense bush on the river bank, which he had never
explored as yet, therefore he was surprised to see his
cousin part the bushes and lead him into a large but
thoroughly concealed opening among the bushes. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
overhanging branches made it a nearly rainproof retreat.
Here Steve found about half-a-dozen members of
the secret smoking club. After a look round, our hero
was offered a smoke, which he accepted, and was soon
puffing away at&mdash;what does the uninitiated reader think?&mdash;a
piece of ratan, which was one of the first stages in
learning the art of smoking in this particular band; the
porous wood of the ratan, or cane, serving as a good
conductor of the smoke from the burning end. Of the
whole band gathered here, only one was advanced
enough to indulge in the real article, viz., tobacco; the
rest were all smoking one, or another, of the different
substitutes for tobacco known to the rising generation.
I suppose the manly reader who has been brought up in
a proper and an enlightened manner has learned to
smoke with the usual cigarette, made up of Turkish,
or mixed tobacco. But these youths, sons of more
or less poor parents, being allowed no pocket money,
had to satisfy themselves with the best substitutes
for tobacco they could discover; and they showed a
rare genius in discovering different cheap articles to
serve their purpose, amongst which were such things
as pumpkin stalk, cane, leaves of various trees, and
various similar rubbish. All this is vulgar is it not?
Yet I can assure you it is not as bad as it sounds.
It produces plenty of the chief thing desired&mdash;smoke!</p>

<p>But to resume. Steve did not remain satisfied for
many days with these insipid and weak substitutes; so
when his cousin, who was the only one who smoked
tobacco regularly, offered to allow him a few puffs at the
real thing, he accepted readily enough, and smoked
like all novices generally do, viz., smoked as if his
life depended upon his finishing the pipe as fast as
possible. All went well until he had finished the pipe,
for while he was yet smoking, he had thought it not at
all as nasty as it had been described to him. But
when he had put the pipe down (which was made
of two joints of reeds, one about an inch in diameter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
serving as the bowl, and another one with a tiny
opening serving as the stem) he began to feel the
effects. He felt as if the world were whirling round
and round on purpose to make him sick. He
made his way to some water the best way he could,
plunged his head therein and washed out his mouth,
but nothing would take away that awful feeling which
most readers who are also smokers know to be the
effect of the first pipe of tobacco. It was only after
having lain down on the grass for an hour or so, with
closed eyes, vowing innumerable vows never to touch
tobacco again, that he got well enough to go home,
amid the teasings and jokes of his companions. But I
must state here that Steve did not keep his vow never
to touch tobacco again. Who does not make these
vows when learning to smoke, and who does not break
them? Steve tried again and again, and after having
broken his pipe and renewed his vow not to smoke again
for some dozen times, he succeeded at last in smoking
without getting sick, and to-day he can smoke his pipe
against any man.</p>

<span class="medium">A CHARACTER SKETCH OF OUR HERO</span></h3>

<p>Steve was not fond of school. He liked studying and
learning, but he wanted to select his own studies, and
hated to be forced to learn what he did not wish to
study. He was passionately fond of books, with
hardly any distinction. He would never allow a book
to pass out of his hand without first reading it, if he
could help it. If he got hold of a book he would read
it. If he had no time, he would make time. While
walking in the street, he would be holding the book in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
front of his nose, while carefully feeling his steps, or
while taking his hurried meals, or when other people
were soundly sleeping at night, and even in school he
would find time to read; and read books, too, which no
teacher of any self-respect would have tolerated. But
what did Steve care for the opinion of his teacher as
to what books he should read? A book was a book
to him, to be used and to be made the most of
possible. He would smuggle the book into school
under his coat, and while his teacher was thinking that
Steve was studying his lessons most diligently, that
young man would be deeply interested in some book of
travels, or something of the kind. Not that Steve did
not learn his lessons. He did learn them, but it did not
take him long to do so; reading his task over once or
twice was quite sufficient for him to know as much of it
as he cared to know. His object was not to be at the
top of his class. No, his nature was too retiring to
allow him to render himself as conspicuous as all that.
If he did happen to come up top by accident, he made
his way down to the bottom again as fast as he could.
His friend, Gus Turner, was also fond of being at the
bottom of the class, but not from choice, but perforce
because his mental abilities did not allow him to get up
higher, and he always did his best to keep Steve near
him, for he found Steve useful to prompt him when
his own knowledge of questions asked, failed him.
Steve always obliged his friend as best he could, both in
supplying answers as well as in keeping near him at the
bottom of the class. One day he was caught in the act.
The teacher had come down with a question right from
the top of the class, and no one could answer the
question asked, until he had come to Steve, who
thoughtlessly answered it correctly. ‘Go up top,’ said
the teacher. But Steve quietly kept his seat. He was
not going to leave his friend at the bottom while he
went to the top! The teacher soon noticed this, and
asked him why he did not go up. He replied that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
did not care to do so. ‘Go to the bottom then,’ commanded
the angry teacher. Steve did so. What did he
care? His friend was at the bottom; he had been just
above him, now he was just below him. What difference
did it make?</p>

<p>I have said that Steve was fond of reading; he
was also fond of <i>thinking</i>&mdash;day-dreaming. His great
delight was, when he had the time for it, as on Sundays,
for instance, to go out for a walk into the veld, and
find a shady grassy spot on which to lie on his back,
looking up into the sky, to <i>think</i>&mdash;think about all sorts
of things, past, present, and future. He did not fear
to try and think out problems which had puzzled
greater and more matured brains than his. There was
one great mystery to which his thoughts generally would
come back again and again. He could generally find
some solution to all questions that cropped up, but
this particular one would not be solved, turn it over
as he would. This mystery was&mdash;<i>Space</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="medium">THOUGHTS AND FLOWERS</span></h3>

<p>While thus lying on his back, gazing up into the
bright South African sky, with the sun seemingly floating
as an atom in all the immensity of space; and the sun
he had learned in his books was ever so many times
larger than our earth, and yet it seemed only a speck
in space. ‘Space, space, what is space? Where does it
begin? Where does it end?’ And then he would fly
on in imagination from world to world, from star to
star, from sun to sun, but his imagination could not
find even a probable ending for space. He had never
read anything on the subject to help him. He had
never read any book in which he had seen what others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
thought of the subject, so he had to puzzle his own
poor brain, eternally thinking, thinking ever on it.
<i>Surely</i>, <small>SURELY</small> there must be some answer to this
problem. Surely there <small>MUST</small> be a beginning to space
as well as an end, otherwise how can it be, and yet
it <i>cannot</i> have beginning or end. He felt as if he
should get mad trying to think it out; and when he
got so far as to feel his brain reeling in endeavouring
to pierce beyond the mystery of space, he would
jump up and shout and laugh, and run about looking
for his favourite wild flowers in order to forget this
maddening thought, but it would come back to him
whenever he was alone and thinking.</p>

<p>Speaking about flowers&mdash;that was another of his passions.
He was never so happy as when tending his few
flowers. He was famous for the beauty of the wild
flowers he generally gathered in the mountains when
he had time. He used to think a half-holiday well spent
if he could take a walk into the mountains to gather a
beautiful bouquet of his favourite wild flowers. As has
been suggested before, he was of a retiring nature, and
greatly disliked crowds. At any festival in town, when
everybody, including his own family, would all eagerly
gather together to enjoy themselves by seeing and being
seen, he would rather go for a walk in the veld, where
his thoughts were his only company&mdash;and good company
he always found them. Or he would find a comfortable
nook and read a book, during which occupation he
would forget the rest of the world and be happy.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="medium">STEP-CHILDREN</span></h3>

<p>Steve’s mother had married again a few years after his
father’s death. She would have preferred remaining unmarried,
as she considered it would have been more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
faithful to the memory of her dead husband; but she
found herself too poor to educate her children unaided,
and bring them up as she would like to do. It was not
a happy marriage, which is usually the case where there
are step-children to cause jealousy&mdash;the more so when
the step-parent is not of the best-natured and gentlest
character. Steve’s stepfather respected and, in his way,
loved his wife; but he disliked Steve, because that
youngster was a manly and proud little fellow, and
rebelled against his stepfather when the latter treated
him unjustly, or ill-treated his little sisters: which his
stepfather often did, more out of spite to Steve than from
any other reason.</p>

<p>He used to make Steve work (out of school hours) in
the garden, chop wood, carry water, and, in fact, he invented
work for the poor boy if there was no work really
wanting to be done. Poor Steve did all this most patiently
and dutifully, even though he lost his play hours;
for he did not really care much for the usual boyish
games of his companions. All he cared for was to secure
a candle end to read his beloved books by at night, when
everybody else was sleeping, or to take his walk into the
veld on Sundays, after church time. Amidst the beauties
of Nature, which he loved with the love of a true child
of Nature, he was happy. He was patient and enduring
amidst the petty persecutions of his stepfather, for his
mother’s sake, while it only concerned himself. He did
not even complain when his stepfather one day found
him stealing a glimpse into a new book which he had
borrowed from a friend and cruelly took it from him
and cast it into the fire. His stepfather could not have
done him greater personal injury if he had tried for a
month to find the way. But Steve took it quietly and
patiently, even though it was a borrowed book and it
would take some of his few most-treasured books to
satisfy his friend from whom he had borrowed the volume.
Steve was accustomed to these daily persecutions from
his stepfather.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>But there were times when even his stepfather was
awed into fear of him&mdash;that was when Steve considered
his sisters ill-treated. To give an instance.</p>

<p>Steve’s mother had a son by her second husband, seven
years old at this time&mdash;a child who, perhaps, would have
been a good boy if he had been left to his mother’s care
and training. But his father utterly spoiled him by giving
him his desires and wishes unstinted, no matter at
what sacrifice or how foolish those wishes were. If it was
the most precious article belonging to his stepbrother or
sisters, if he asked for it, he was to have it. Steve had
long rebelled against this, especially on behalf of his
sisters, but always to no effect. In fact, he made himself
only the more hated by his stepfather. He did not dislike
his little half-brother; he wished to treat and love
him as his mother’s child, but the child’s father made
this an impossibility for Steve, through his continual
injustice. The result was that the boy was perfectly
spoiled, and, whenever he saw his brother or sisters have
anything new, he used to cry for it until his father made
them give it up to him.</p>

<p>One evening the whole family was sitting round the
table, waiting for evening prayers, at which the mother
always insisted that everyone should be present. Steve’s
sister, Dora, had that day secured at school a pretty little
picture book; she was sitting looking at this when her
little stepbrother, who was sitting next to her, snatched
at the book and tore a leaf. She, of course, pulled the
book away from him, which made the spoiled child set
up a fearful howling. His father got up and gave poor,
innocent little Dora a severe slap on the cheek, which made
the poor child turn blue from pain in a moment. Steve
could not stand this. He was now sixteen years of age,
and could not quietly see his little sister treated in such
a cruel and unjust way.</p>

<p>He rose, pale from anger, and, striking his fist on the
table, which made the different articles thereon jump
again, said in a voice hard and firm,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>‘By God, if you strike my sister again in that way, I
shall kill you. Do you hear?’ And his voice sounded and
his expression looked so threatening, that the coward (all
blusterers are cowards) felt awed and afraid. He had
not the courage to brave Steve in his anger. He looked
down and did not say a word more.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="medium">FAVOURITE HEROES</span></h3>

<p>When Steve was fifteen years of age he was taken from
school and placed in an office at a small&mdash;very small&mdash;salary.</p>

<p>His education was not completed yet by far. He
could read <i>well</i>, write fairly well, of arithmetic he knew
sufficient for the ordinary wants of business life; his
grammar was only sufficient to help him to speak English
fairly correctly, with a mistake only once in a while. In
orthography he was proficient enough to write a fairly
well spelled letter. In history he excelled&mdash;that was his
favourite study, no matter whose history it was. Bible,
secular, English, Dutch, Italian, but especially South
African, French and American history, he studied; the
latter two because they were Republics, for he was a
thorough Republican, and wished to know everything
about Republicanism.</p>

<p>He loved to read the story of Napoleon. He gloried
in Napoleon’s genius, in his wonderful victories. But
he grieved over the follies of the <i>Emperor</i>. The General
Bonaparte, even the first Consul was his admiration&mdash;but
the Emperor was a monster to him. He could not
understand that a man, who had displayed such wonderful
genius as Napoleon had done, could make such
foolish mistakes as Napoleon had made as Emperor.
He could not understand that such a man should care
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
for the empty pomps and vanities of a throne. To his
mind Napoleon would have been a <i>greater</i> man by far if he
had remained only a Consul or President of the French
<i>Republic</i>. Why a man who had done what he had done
for France, and who had striven to the end to live and
work only for the people, who wished to live for posterity
as a man who had won the <i>hearts</i> of his people (such a
man would be nobler and grander by far than one like
Napoleon proved in the end) had only used his
country and people to work for his own glory and
vanity, puzzled Steve.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he considered George Washington
by far a greater and nobler man than Napoleon.
For Washington had lived and fought <i>only</i> for his
country, and had proved to be nobly unselfish to the
end. <i>The States</i>, in his opinion, really did “lick creation”
as a great and free country.</p>

<p>The history of his own country he simply devoured.
He never lost an opportunity of getting hold of a book
which treated in any way of South Africa. If the book
spoke favourably of his country and people, he was pleased
and happy. If the book libelled his country&mdash;as so many
books really do&mdash;he was grieved, but treated it with the
contempt it deserved, and took his revenge by extracting
any information he found in it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="medium">OUT OF SCHOOL</span></h3>

<p>As we stated in the last chapter, Steve was taken from
school before his education was at all fairly completed
and placed in an office. This was done against the
wishes of his mother; but his stepfather said he could
not have him eating the roof off the house and live a
lazy, good-for-nothing life any longer&mdash;he must work and
earn his living.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>William Waitz (which was the name of Steve’s stepfather)
wanted to make a mechanic of the poor boy, but
his mother, who understood his nature, would not allow
this. <i>She</i> knew this was altogether against the wishes
and abilities of her son, and she insisted that he should
be placed in an office. Her influence&mdash;and a good
woman’s influence, even on a bad man, always makes
itself felt&mdash;gained for Steve the victory, and he was not
placed with a mechanic, which he would have hated.
He desired opportunities to improve himself mentally,
and how could he improve himself so as a mason or brick-layer?</p>

<p>Steve knew his education was by no means complete,
but he did not mind leaving school, for he ardently
desired to earn his own living and to be independent;
besides, he did not intend to leave off studying, only
now he could choose his own subjects for study.
History&mdash;political and natural&mdash;astronomy, geography,
books on agriculture, horticulture, tree culture, apiculture,
all were welcome to him; he would as readily read
and study the one as the other, and on many a night, when
his stepfather sent him hungry and starving to bed as a
punishment for doing nothing in particular, he would
console himself and forget his hunger in reading some
book or other. It was nothing unusual for him to be
caught by the daybreak stealing into his little room, his
candle still burning, and he deeply immersed in his
book.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="medium">HOPES</span></h3>

<p>For the first couple of years Steve’s earnings all went
into the pockets of his stepfather. But during the third
year Steve simply refused to give up more than three-quarters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
of his salary, for his father supplied him only
with the barest necessities in clothing, and he considered
he was entitled to a small portion of his earnings to buy
such things as he wished for, such as books, etc.</p>

<p>The first thing Steve did, when he found himself
absolute owner of a portion of his earnings, was to subscribe
to the local library, even though he sadly wanted
a new suit and a new pair of boots. But to be able to
select his own books to read from such a stock of books
as the library contained, he would have sacrificed almost
anything.</p>

<p>He first of all inquired for all books dealing with his
beloved South Africa; and if he could find any dealing
with the Transvaal or Orange Free State, he was doubly
happy. The Transvaal and the Free State were to him as
two shining stars in an otherwise dark sky; they were
the two states in which <i>his</i> people were <i>free</i>. Ah! how
he used to long to go to the Transvaal and live where
he could feel free, and say, ‘Here I am a man, for here
I can look everybody in the eyes and feel I am his equal,
and not subject to a foreign race,’ His plan was firmly
made up to go to the Transvaal as soon as ever he could
manage to do so. The time did arrive at last when he
could go.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="medium">THE TRANSVAAL IN PROSPECTIVE</span></h3>

<p>Steve had always watched with absorbing interest the
progress of events in the Transvaal. He had seen with
intense pity the struggle of the Republican Government
to make ends meet, and to prevent financial ruin. But
he always trusted that all would come right; and it was
with a joy almost greater than if his own fortune was in
question that he&mdash;at last&mdash;saw the rising fortunes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
the South African Republic. He saw the reported discoveries
of gold at Barberton; which already gave a
great stimulus to commerce and trade; and then, as if
Providence had determined at last to make the Transvaal
prosperous and rich, far beyond the dreams of
avarice, the grand discoveries at the Witwatersrand
followed those of Barberton, which in turn were augmented
by further discoveries all over the district.
Miles of main reef were traced out, companies with
enormous capitals were promoted, and a time of great
prosperity and successful speculation followed. Fortunes
were made and lost in a week, a day, an hour. The
Government revenues rose by leaps and bounds, and
they had no longer to almost beg for the loan of a few
thousands. Capitalists were only too eager to advance
money on such safe securities as could be offered.</p>

<p>Government officials, who before had to work for the
love of country and people only, now received their
rewards; from the highest to the lowest they were able to
now receive their salaries at the end of the month. And
when the finances of the country were placed on a sound
and safe footing, the Volksraad did the right thing at
the right time by advancing salaries all round.</p>

<p>The reported rich finds, so marvellous and so rich at
the Witwatersrand, were soon noised all over the world;
and people flocked from all quarters of the globe to the
goldfields. They came, saw, and were satisfied&mdash;even
as the Queen of Sheba was&mdash;that all the riches of the
Rand had not been reported to them.</p>

<p>A township was laid out and given a name&mdash;Johannesburg.
Who has not heard of it? Johannesburg
became the ninth wonder of the world. It rose, as if in
one night, and became a great and well-built city, such
as can be found no where else in South Africa, and, in
certain senses, nowhere else in the world!</p>

<p>Beautiful buildings, strong and lasting, rose, as if by
enchantment, one after the other, proving that confidence
was not wanting in the stability of the goldfields.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>Johannesburg differed greatly from other goldfields in
other countries. In Australia and California, when a
goldfield was first rushed, tents and tin shanties prevailed.
Here, buildings in brick and stone were prominent
everywhere. In the former, law and order was
noted for its absence; here, everything was done most
orderly and lawfully, which showed once more the
ability of the Boer Government to govern even such a
community, and that not by display of force. Comparatively
few police were kept; only sufficient for watching
the individual criminal and vagabond that even such a
law-abiding goldfield will attract.</p>

<p>It was, and is, a marvel to many how order and law
were kept and administered by such a weak show of
police. I believe it was simply the conscious strength
and stability of the Government which was felt, if not
seen, by all parties, combined by the promptness of the
Government to remove all just causes of complaints, and
to give aid where aid was required. No honest and just
memorial was ever refused by Government. The only
request which could not be granted was the Franchise,
the justness and fairness of which is open to question,
and appears altogether in a different view when seen
either by the one side or the other. But of this we
shall see more anon.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="medium">THE NESTLING PREPARING FOR FLIGHT</span></h3>

<p>Well, Steve thought these things all tended to realise
his dream of becoming a Transvaaler.</p>

<p>One thing only troubled him; would it be right for
him to desert his mother and sisters? After long thinking,
he decided to leave it to his mother to decide for
him, so he went to her and said,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>‘Mother, you know I have always wished to go to the
Transvaal; you know what my father said on his death-bed;
that I must do all I can to make our people one
strong nation, and I can do more for them in a country
where they are free and independent. From there I can
work as if entrenched in a castle, and who knows, some
time we might be able to <i>free</i> our people in this country
too? But on the other hand, father also said I must
look after you and my sisters; do you think I ought to
stay here? do you think I can do more for you staying
at home, or can I do as much or more by going to the
Transvaal, and work and try and make enough money to
be able to help you and my sisters in time of need?’</p>

<p>‘My son, the thought of losing you is dreadful, and
that alone could induce me to keep you here; but my
love for you is above being selfish; I can only wish for
what is best for you, and if you think you can do better
in the Transvaal, let not the thought of me or your sisters,
keep you back. We can get on, and we shall write to
you every week, and if we need you, or aid from you, we
shall not fail to let you know. I would not thus give
you up so easily, but I know your heart is set upon
going; I have expected it for a long time. I believe I
can trust you to keep your name and heart pure even
thus far away from me; and God will watch over you.’
She wept. Even though she appeared to give him up so
easily, to go far away from her, not to see him again,
perhaps for years, perhaps never again on earth, her
heart was torn to the very roots. But she was an unselfish
mother, and would not sacrifice her son’s well-being
and future prospects to her love.</p>

<p>‘But, mother, will father be as good to you and sisters
when I am away as when I am here, for, without vanity,
I may say I think he fears me just enough to forbear
from ill-treating my sisters, and when I am away he may
feel no such restraint.’</p>

<p>‘Better, I think,’ replied his mother, ‘for I really
believe it is the antagonism he feels for you that makes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
him bad-tempered and cruel sometimes. I think if you
are away, and ceased to irritate him, he will be a better
stepfather and wife to us.’</p>

<p>‘Mother, you have decided for me. I go as soon as I
can hear of an opening!’</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="medium">COUSINS</span></h3>

<p>Steve’s cousin and namesake had proceeded to the
Transvaal some months before this.</p>

<p>We have mentioned the young man before as Steve’s
tutor in the art of smoking. A few words as regards
him will not be out of place here, as we may hear, off
and on, of his doings, as affecting Steve. We have said
before that he was a vacillating young man; a fact which
he showed in every act of his life. Years before he surprised
Steve’s constant young heart, during the Transvaal
war of independence, by declaring&mdash;while the issue
was as yet uncertain&mdash;that the English would give the
Boers such a licking as they would never forget. He declared
the Boers were cowards. He was one of those
that took up the saying, that the Boers would run away
at the first cannon shot. He changed his mind when
the Boers were successful. <i>Now</i> he composed songs,
in which he celebrated the victory of the Republicans
in glowing terms, and abused the English tyrants enough
to suit the taste of the most fiery Republican. Such was
his nature. He was inconstant to his friends, he was
inconstant to his sweethearts (mind the plural), he was
inconstant to himself!</p>

<p>Like all such natures, he was a braggart and boaster.
When he was amongst strangers he was a Crœsus in
wealth, a king in power. Amongst his friends, he had
always seen and done things wonderful to relate. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
not one of them seemed ever to have the luck to be
present when he saw and did these things. But his
acquaintances knew him, and generally treated his stories
with derision and contempt. Their ironical questions
and looks appeared to his vanity questions and looks of
belief and wonder.</p>

<p>He was not actually ill-natured or unkind. He had his
tender spots. Real pain and grief greatly affected him,
and brought pity into his heart, and at such times he
was always amongst the first to render aid. In this respect
only he resembled Steve. In all else he was
his direct opposite. His vanity, love of boasting, and
wish to thrust himself into a prominent part of whatever
was taking place, together with a weakness to be on the
side of the stronger party, was the bane of his life.
The worst of him was that he did not seem to realise
the shame and dishonour of deserting his party when it
seemed to be on the losing side and taking up with the
stronger.</p>

<p>Steve hated these faults in his cousin, and tried to
reason sense and honour into him. But, being several
years the junior of his cousin, his opinions were considered
as childish, and disregarded. So Steve could
only view his cousin’s backslidings with patience and
grief; which he did; as he was thrown into daily contact
with his cousin through force of circumstances.
In one thing or another he had to do with him every day,
and really bore him a sort of cousinly affection, but this
was unaccompanied by any respect.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="medium">THE RISING GENERATION</span></h3>

<p>When Steve’s cousin left for the Transvaal a sort of correspondence
was kept up between them. Steve took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
advantage of this to write to his cousin and ask him to
look for a situation for him.</p>

<p>At this time, through the force of circumstances&mdash;the
want of proper schools, the struggle for existence against
poverty, native troubles, and other difficulties&mdash;the youth
of the Transvaal were seldom educated enough to take
their proper places in the civil service of their country, or
in the commercial, law, or other offices, so that the Government
were forced to employ Hollanders, young educated
Afrikanders from the Cape Colony and elsewhere, in the
civil service; and merchants, as well as other employers,
were forced to do the same, the only difference being, that
for Government service a knowledge of official language&mdash;Dutch&mdash;was
absolutely necessary for applicants, while
private offices were not always particular, especially commercial
offices. Hence the abuse the Government has
had to suffer on account of employing so many of their
Hollander brothers. These disabilities on the part of
born Transvaalers are gradually disappearing through
the fostering care of Government. Schools are State-aided
in an instituted manner now, and young Transvaalers
are continually entering Government service
more and more every day.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="medium">THE APRON STRINGS CUT</span></h3>

<p>For the reason given in the last chapter, it did not
take Steve’s cousin long to find a good situation for
him; and when Steve received the letter in which his
success was told, and bidding him come up without a
day’s delay, his joy was unbounded.</p>

<p>His preparations did not take long. By selling
everything that he had which he could not take with
him, and scraping together every penny he had, he just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
managed to get together sufficient to take him to
Pretoria&mdash;his final destination. Why linger over Steve’s
leave-takings from friends and relatives? why should
we restrain him with our presence when he bids good-bye
to mother and sisters? why visit with him for the last
time the haunts of his childhood? Many of us do not
require to be told what took place, many of us have
gone through it ourselves, have cast a lingering look on
a beloved walk, or favoured spot, have given the last
pressure to the hands of dear ones weeping, have felt the
choking sensation which prevents the voice from saying
the last word we fain would say, but must leave unsaid
through emotion.</p>

<p>Steve was on his way to Eldorado; to the land of
freedom and wealth; to the land where were centred all
his hopes and ambitions for the future.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had left home for longer than
a week; but in spite of his regrets to leave home, mother
and sisters, he felt happy. He left as if he was a man at
last. Free. He was going to fight the battle of life
unaided; he asked for naught but a fair field and no
favour.</p>

<p>Ah, Nature looked doubly glorious that morning as he
rode through the surrounding hills and valleys and felt
the genial sunshine and breathed the pure free air.</p>

<p>We will not accompany him any farther. We will
leave him travelling on the top of the coach, enjoying his
freedom and the beauties of Nature, as viewed from his
lofty perch, free to indulge in his day-dreams and build
his air castles unstinted for material; his rich imagination
supplied all. The future is his; we will meet him in
Johannesburg.

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="medium">FIRST VIEW OF JOHANNESBURG</span></h3>

<p>A coach halts in front of the coaching office, Johannesburg,
a young man gets down and bustles about to
secure his luggage, for here the coaches change, a
new one has to be taken for Pretoria.</p>

<p>Of course this young man is no other than Steve. He
arranges for his luggage to remain at the office until the
Pretoria coach leaves, which will not be until three
o’clock in the afternoon; it is only 10 a.m. now. He
thinks the best thing he can do is to have a look round
and see as much as he can of the place while he has the
opportunity. He turns to a young man&mdash;whose acquaintance
he has made during the journey on the coach,
and who was returning to Pretoria, after spending a
short holiday at the sea-coast&mdash;and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I say, Harrison, what are you going to do while you
wait for the coach?’</p>

<p>‘I am sure I don’t know. Kill time as best I can, I
suppose.’</p>

<p>‘Suppose you act as guide and mentor for me in viewing
the place. You know the place&mdash;I don’t&mdash;and you
might take me to the places most worth seeing during
the few hours we have. Come, be charitable this once,
and help a green un.’</p>

<p>‘All right, old boy, I am always willing to be unselfish,
and besides it will do as well as anything else to kill time
and keep me out of mischief.’</p>

<p>He took Steve all over the principal streets to Hospital
Hill, and gave him a bird’s eye view of all the surrounding
places; and a sight worth seeing, too, it was to a
young man that had just left a quiet provincial town. It
was all bustle and vigour wherever he looked. It seemed
as if there was an electric power in the air which forced
everyone to do and act; no lingering or looking backward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
here, on, on, seems to be the watchword, or be left
behind, to catch up never again. Even Steve seemed
to feel this mysterious influence stealing over him as he
stood gazing on the busy throng; he felt as if he would
like to rush into the midst of them and to push and
elbow his way until he was amongst the first, to stay
there. For the moment Steve forgot his natural inclination
to be reserved and quiet; he felt as if he could push
and rush on with the best of them.</p>

<p>But other thoughts soon came crowding on; thoughts
of pride and joy that he at last had the privilege to see
the place fully which was so famous all over the world
for its riches.</p>

<p>And this place belonged to his people&mdash;to the Afrikanders.
Here they were free, and the equal of other races.
Here they had the right to work out their own destiny.
Ah, it was something to be proud of; this youthful but
mighty and growing city; these surrounding and undulating
plains, underneath whose green grass has lain
concealed for ages past untold wealth. Wealth which
was laid and preserved by Providence for the purpose of
helping the people of his race to rescue their country from
poverty and financial ruin.</p>

<p>Ah, God has been good to us. He means it well with
us. We have a right to hope that he shall lead us on
right to the end, if only we can remain true to Him as a
people.</p>

<p>He spoke something of the latter thought to his companion,
who was an Englishman, and who supposed Steve
to be an Englishman too, from his pure accent, as he had
learned to speak English very well, and with a purer
English accent than is generally acquired by Afrikanders,
through being in daily contact in his six years of business
life with Englishmen. His companion replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘My dear fellow, do you think that this rich mining
country will long remain in the possession of the Boers?
If you do you are mightily mistaken. If the Boers do
not themselves soon begin to see that they are unable to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
keep all these Uitlanders in order, and ask the British
Government to take the government of the country over,
then England will take it over whether they consent or
not?’</p>

<p>Steve felt a pang shoot through his heart.</p>

<p>‘But how can England take their freedom from them?
They have once tried to do so, and the Boers fought for
their country and liberty and got it back. How can
England take it now again?’</p>

<p>‘My dear fellow, you must remember that at that time
this country was only a poor, worthless desert and England
did not consider it worth while fighting for?’</p>

<p>‘Take that for granted; but even then, do you think
England would be so unjust to take the country from the
Boers again, just because it turns out to be richer than
she thought; that would be disgraceful.’</p>

<p>‘But England has, through her capitalists, thousands
of pounds sterling&mdash;and soon it will be millions&mdash;at stake
in the goldfields of the country; she is bound to look
after the money her subjects have placed in this country.’</p>

<p>‘Let us put it plainly,’ said Stephen. ‘You have a
house, I have a thousand pounds; I wish to find a safe
hiding-place for my money, I think your house just the
place; I hide it there, without your request or permission.
But, on after thoughts, I think my money would be much
safer if I had possession of the house instead of you.
I arm myself; I go to you and say, “You clear out of this,
my money is not safe while you remain in possession.”
You refuse to go. I put a bullet through your brain,
carry you out, bury you, and take full possession. My
money is safe now, no more need be said&mdash;might is right.
That is about how you place the case.’</p>

<p>Harrison shrugged his shoulders, and replied doggedly,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘You do not understand these national affairs; it is
otherwise than with individual personal affairs,’</p>

<p>‘I hope I may never understand it, if it means dishonour,’
replied Steve.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>After this they wended their way to view a mine or two,
from the outside, as they felt they could not spare the
time then to go inside a mine. There was very little
to be seen from the outside&mdash;a large shed-like building,
hauling gear over a seemingly bottomless pit, surrounded
by heaps of quartz and débris. Steve could hardly
realise that this apparently hard, common stone, called
quartz, really represented the great wealth of the mines.
He had hoped to see, at least, some visible gold, but he
was disappointed. It was just hard, flint-like stone, without
a particle of yellow metal visible; and yet he was
assured the gold was extracted in paying quantities from
this stone.</p>

<p>After this they returned to town, to seek some refreshments,
and came to a large building in course of erection.</p>

<p>Steve saw a couple of children playing close by, under
the scaffolding; he took no particular note of them, but
stood admiring the architecture of the building.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a cry of horror behind him; he saw
a gentleman and lady standing with upheld hands, with
a horror-struck and transfixed expression, looking at the
children near to him; he turned, and what he saw sent a
thrill of horror through him. He loved children, and
would rather bear pain himself a thousand times than
see a child in pain, wherefore he felt the danger of a
child all the more. What he saw was this: A little girl
was standing under the scaffolding, innocently looking at
a beautiful doll another girl was carrying in the street,
without seeing the terrible danger that was threatening
her. Above her a tremendously heavy beam, which was
securely tied at one end, was slipping down on the
opposite side, a workman was holding the dangerous end.
A rope was tied round it, and he was holding with all his
might to prevent its falling; but the weight was too much
for him. He dared not take breath to call out for help,
the waste of the least breath, or the least bit of strength
taken from the effort of holding the beam, would precipitate
its fall. But it was slipping&mdash;slipping. ‘My
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
God,’ thought he, ‘will no one see and take away that
child.’ Someone saw. The cry of the mother of the
child and the look of horror on her face had drawn Steve’s
attention to the danger. He saw all we have described
in the flash of an eye. Not a moment did he hesitate or
think what he should do. He never lost his presence of
mind in danger. Like the arrow from a bow, he flew
right under the threatening beam, the fall of which
meant death to any living creature that might be under
it. He seized the child by the dress, and came out
on the opposite side of the beam. He felt a shock
against his shoulder, as if some heavy object struck
him. He felt himself whirled round several times by the
shock, and thrown against the wall. The thunder, as of
a falling mountain, sounded in his ears. But he held
the child firmly in his arms; she was safe. The beam
had fallen, if Steve had been a fraction of a second later,
or the beam had fallen a fraction of a second sooner,
both he and the child would have been crushed. As it
was, it just grazed his shoulder. He was unhurt save for
a severe bruise on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Of course, a crowd collected in a moment. The
mother and father had rushed over from the opposite
side of the street where they had been standing. The
mother was hugging and kissing the child; the father
was wringing the hand of Steve, with protestations of
gratitude and service. A re-action came for the mother;
she felt faint and could scarcely speak her gratitude to
Steve. So her husband hurried her to a carriage with
the child, and going to Steve said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘My friend, you have done a brave action; you have
saved my child, on whose life the happiness of my wife
and myself depends. I am your friend and debtor for
life; here is my card. Let me see you this afternoon,
and if there is anything I can do for you, I trust you will
let me know it. I would not leave you now, but I must
take my wife home.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir,’ replied Steve; he was thankful to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
be prevented from saying more by being pushed and
pulled away by the crowd.</p>

<p>He hurried to find his companion (who had seen and
heard all), and said to him, ‘Come on, Harrison; we
have no time to lose, if we do not wish to lose our
coach!’</p>

<p>‘What, are you going away without accepting the
invitation of your new-found debtor? I would not, if I
were you. He might do something good for you. Let
me see his card.’</p>

<p>On seeing the name on the card, he whistled in surprise.</p>

<p>‘I say, young fellow, your fortune is made; I wish I
were you. Why, man, the name on this card represents
the most successful speculator and company promoter
on the Rand. Why, a tip from him is worth thousands.
Of course you will change your mind and let the coach
take care of itself, and go and see him as he requested.’</p>

<p>‘Of course not; I do not like this fuss and bother
about nothing. I do not wish to be paid for doing a
humane action. Come on, let us be off,’ And in
spite of his companion’s repeated advice not to lose such
an opportunity to make his way in the world, Steve
boarded the coach and left for Pretoria.</p>

<p>Quixotic? Yes, I suppose so. Unworthy the nineteenth
century? No! I think the nineteenth century
is unworthy of such Quixotism. Such an act is only
worthy of the time of knight errantry, when men acted only
for the honour of the thing, and every deed was not valued
in £ s. d. But then Steve lived in that time in a sense&mdash;in
a shell; his shell was composed of books, in which
such creeds are still taught and tolerated, even though
they are derided and laughed down in actual life&mdash;that is,
in ultra-civilised life, which really means ‘live for self, and
self only; nothing for nothing, and everything for <i>gold</i>.’
But Steve was unacquainted with this creed as yet; let
us hope that he will never become the slave of such a
creed.

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="medium">PRETORIA AND ITS LIFE</span></h3>

<p>The writer of this has never admired the works of Rider
Haggard; they are too untrue&mdash;untrue to Nature and the
probabilities of life, and certainly untrue to facts, which
are grossly exaggerated. But even in winter a strayed
swallow is seen in our country. On the barest plain a
tree is met occasionally, and in Haggard’s work I
once came across something with which I can cordially
agree. It is long ago since I read it, but it so surprised
me that I have always remembered it. Yet it is so long
since I read it that I am not quite sure in which of his
works I saw it; but if I am not mistaken the thing is in
<i>Jess</i>. The passage I refer to is where he says that
Pretoria is the prettiest town in South Africa; and if
Haggard thought so in the days when he knew
Pretoria, when the streets were swamps, covered with
grass, and it was a danger to venture out of doors after
dark for fear of breaking a limb in some concealed hole,
when no better building&mdash;or hardly better&mdash;than the
house which Jess inhabited existed in the town, what
must we say of it now, when the streets have been
rebuilt (more or less), when beautiful buildings&mdash;the
best and grandest in South Africa&mdash;have been raised;
merchant princes have erected palaces, beautiful stores
rival European houses, and Government has covered a
block of ground with a pile of buildings of which even
Pretoria can be proud. Even Nature herself has been
improved upon, if I may be allowed to say so. Plantations
of trees have been planted, where formerly bare
plots of ground existed, beautifully laid out ornamental
and flower gardens enchant the vision. A block of
tares, which grew only a crop of grass formerly, is now
laid out in a beautiful park, worthy the name, with a
large fish pond in the centre, and even a substantially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
built bandstand has been added lately. All in all,
Pretoria more than deserves the name so often applied
to it, ‘Pretty Pretoria’; it really deserves to be called
beautiful Pretoria.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that Steve, who possessed a keenly
appreciative eye for the beautiful, was enchanted with
the view which met his eye when he entered Pretoria
through the <i>poort</i>, from which emerges the road leading
into it from Johannesburg, and he felt&mdash;like so many
others have felt before and since&mdash;that once having
seen Pretoria, a man may travel the world over, but he
would ever feel a longing to be back in Pretoria.
Many have felt this longing when in foreign lands, and
have come back. Steve found his cousin waiting for
him at the halting-place, and was soon introduced into
his room at the quiet boarding-house, which had been
secured for him at his request.</p>

<p>After a few days spent in resting after travelling
for days in a cramped and crowded position, and
becoming acquainted with the town in which he had
resolved to make his home, Steve took his place
in the office where he had secured the much-desired
situation.</p>

<p>It did not take Steve long to get well into the
mysteries of his work and the good graces of his employer
and fellow-clerks. What pleased him most was
that he came in daily contact with the Burghers of the
district, which gave him the opportunity he had desired,
viz., of studying the men whom he looked upon as
heroes, in that they had dared so much and suffered so
much, and had come out of the ordeal safe and
victorious.</p>

<p>He found them distrustful at first, although kind
and respectful. The stranger you are to them, the more
civilly and kindly you are treated, but always with
great reserve. But by studying them, and being always
friendly and cordial towards them, he soon gained their
confidence, and many was the pound of butter and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
biltong, varied now and then by a dozen of eggs, a couple
of fowls, and at Christmas time even a lamb, that he
received from them as tokens of friendship.</p>

<p>He found that the better they knew you, and the
more they liked you, the more they joked with you and
teased you. They are very fond of teasing, which has led
foreigners to take them in earnest, and spread all sorts
of reports, repeating for fact what the Boers said when
they were only what is vulgarly but expressively called
chaffing them. They especially delighted in doing
this to ‘green uns,’ but always with the utmost good
nature, and only when they liked such a ‘green un.’
They would never do it to one whom they disliked
or distrusted. By the good grace and good nature with
which Steve received all this banter, he got to be greatly
liked, and was soon considered as being quite one of
them, and was known to them far and wide. We shall
see a great deal more of them in connection with
Steve’s adventures and life amongst them, and shall
delight to study their character with him with the view
of understanding better this much maligned people.</p>

<p>In this way Steve spent several years of quiet life.
He applied himself vigorously to his work, so that,
as we have said, he soon gained the confidence of his
employers, and speedily obtained promotion and increase
of salary, which enabled him, while saving considerably,
to send many a present to his mother and sisters.</p>

<p>In the boarding-house where he lodged, he found
quite a pleasant party, composed of many nationalities,
amongst whom he struck up many friendships irrespective
of language. He found himself a fellow-lodger
of his cousin; his former travelling companion,
Harrison; another Englishman, a colonial named
Keith, and a young Afrikander named Theron, who
formed his particular circle of friends, and they
generally managed to be together when any excursion
or picnic was undertaken.</p>

<p>Although, as we have said, he did not really <i>agree</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
with his cousin, he felt that in common gratitude towards
him for having obtained a situation for him, and as
a duty due to cousinly affection, he was bound to
include him as one of his friends.</p>

<p>In the boarding-house, the boarders were in the habit
of forming themselves into a sort of free and easy debating
society, for want of better recreation in the long
evenings. That is to say those who did not care to spend
their evenings in bar-rooms and billiard saloons, which
formed Pretoria’s principal places of amusement at this
time. Of course it goes without saying, that Steve kept
clear as much as possible of these places, for he was
accustomed in his native town to the idea that it was a
disgrace for any self-respecting man or youth to be seen
going into a bar. What shocked him was for the first
time to see a girl serving drink in a bar, surrounded by
a coarse and blaspheming crowd of young men. To
him women had always seemed as creatures almost
divine, too good to be touched without veneration. He
thought they should be worshipped at a distance, and
that in their presence the most choice and delicate language
only should be used. There he saw them treated
roughly and disrespectfully, and even handled as if they
were only coarse, common, everyday human beings, and
worst of all they seemed to be pleased with such treatment,
and even to invite it by their actions.</p>

<p>‘Surely,’ thought he, ‘these girls must have mothers
and fathers, who grieve over their disgrace and degradation;
and many of them must have brothers&mdash;what must
their feelings be to see their sisters in such a position?’
And he would utter a silent prayer for God to keep his
sisters innocent and pure. Of course Steve’s horror of
bars and barmaids gradually lessened, and he afterwards
even went so far as to accept an invitation from a friend
now and again to ‘Come and have something cooling
this hot weather,’ or, ‘something warming this cold day?’
(for alcohol seems to have the power to cool on hot days
and <i>warm</i> on cold days); but he never allowed himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
to acquire the habit of frequenting these places, and
when he did enter them, he always treated the barmaids
with the utmost respect; for, said he, ‘The question is
not, whether they are ladies, but whether I am a gentleman.’</p>

<p>Through his always keeping from bad places, and only
going to places where he was sure respectability was
guaranteed, he soon got into a good circle of society in
Pretoria. He was received and welcomed in the best
families, but his pride kept him from taking full advantage
of this. He was too poor to meet them on equal
terms, and rather than meet them as an inferior, even
though it were only in purse, he would rather not meet
them at all, except in a casual way now and again. For
Steve was proud, and, what is more, he was proud of his
pride. ‘For,’ said he, ‘if it were not for my pride, I
would do many a wrong action which now I am too
proud to do.’ He was never too proud to do a good
action. He would stop and speak to the poorest beggar
on the street if he could do good by it. He would walk
alongside of a poor, ill-dressed person in the street, were
his clothes ever so much patched; his hat so old that it
hung over his eyes; he would never think of his dress,
if it were a hard-working, honest man. But he was too
proud to be seen in the company of a well-dressed, idle,
good-for-nothing, bar-frequenting, prostitute-hunting
man. He was too proud to speak or know a flighty, forward
woman. And who shall say that he was wrong?</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="medium">A DEBATE</span></h3>

<p>As we have said before, Steve and his fellow-boarders
sometimes constituted themselves into a sort of debating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
society, in which the public questions of the day were
generally discussed. Let us follow Steve into the
drawing-room, which he is just entering as a heated
debate is on.</p>

<p>‘Hullo, Keith, at it again as usual, running down the
powers that be of the land we live in,’ remarked Steve
on entering. ‘What is the use of knocking your head
against a rock; for I tell you this Government is as firmly
established as a rock. Have you ever seen a big old
mastiff walking along the street, calm and self-contained,
a troop of curs following, barking and snapping at him,
without the mastiff taking the least notice of their noise
or snaps. Well, Oom Paul is the mastiff, the newspapers
that abuse him and petty pot politicians (I hope the
shoe won’t fit you) are the curs; there you have my
opinion.’</p>

<p>‘So you think it currish to stand up for your rights,
and agitate for it?’</p>

<p>‘By no means.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean then?’</p>

<p>‘I think it currish to be perpetually barking and
snapping at a man, as so many of the Jingo imperialistic
papers and private amateur politicians are continually
doing. You do not see it because you do not wish to
do so; but just watch the actions of the Government, no
matter <i>what</i> they may do or decide upon doing, but it
is reviled and cried down. They may do something
with the most honest intention of pleasing the Uitlanders,
but some sinister intention is found, or supposed to be
found, lurking behind it. No contract is given out for
some public work, no matter if the man be the best
workman and has sent in the lowest tender, but somebody
is sure to have taken a bribe from the contractor to work
into his hands, and so with everything, just because it is
a Boer Government; any stick will do to beat a dog
with, or&mdash;a Boer official.’</p>

<p>‘Well, all the same, it is hard lines that an educated
Englishman should submit to laws made by ignorant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
uneducated Boers; we won’t submit to it. Rule Britannia,
Britannia rules the waves, Britons never, never will be
slaves; there you have my opinion.’</p>

<p>‘My dear fellow, no one wants you to submit to it.
I don’t believe you got an invitation from the Boer
Government to come here and live under their laws. All
you have to do is to submit to it or leave. No one will
prevent you or ask you to come back. I do not
say this because I wish to make myself nasty, but, in
common fairness, you must consider what is right.
Here you come into a free Republic, inhabited by a quiet,
peace-loving, God-fearing people. They have obtained
their country after herculean struggles against enemies
from within and without. Again and again they had to
fight for country and liberty, and at last they seem to be
safe, and wealth comes to them. Strangers from afar
come unto them. (Strangers, besides, who are of the
people who have persecuted and chased them from
their old home, “into a new country, and out again”;
and still are they threatened by the Government of
these self-same strangers.) They share their wealth with
these strangers, they give these strangers the protection
of their laws, on an equal footing with themselves.
But these gold-hunting strangers are not satisfied with
this. It is not enough for them to share with the original
owners of the soil&mdash;no, they want to be <i>masters</i>! And
because the owners of the soil will not walk quietly out
of their country and give everything up to the would-be
usurpers, they are reviled, libelled and abused. You are
an Englishman, an Englishman’s boast is supposed to
be <i>love of “fair play,”</i> where does your love of fair play
come in here?’</p>

<p>‘But if they wish to share with us, why do they not
share the franchise with us?’</p>

<p>‘That is it&mdash;you are asking for the handle of the
knife. You know very well that if the franchise is given
to every Tom, Dick and Harry, the Uitlanders will get
hold of the handle, and if the Boers should try to pull it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
out of their hands, they will cut their fingers. You are
asking them to simply commit political suicide. No, old
man, a thing obtained, as their liberty was obtained, will be
more cherished than to be thus lightly given up. Now, if
your intentions were honest and fair to the Boers, you
would quietly wait your hour until the stipulated time
expires, when you may legally become a Burgher; and if
the time appears rather long, I have perfect confidence
that, if the Uitlanders will only show the Government
that they wish to become peaceful, law-abiding citizens
of the Republic, anxious to advance the honour and
prosperity of the country of their adoption, which they
can only do by working with the Government, and ceasing
to show their prejudice to everything that is <i>Boer</i>, then
I am sure the Government will soon shorten the time of
probation, and take them into the fold of full burghership.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but we are not going to humble ourselves and
beg for a vote; no, by Jingo! sooner than that, we will
fight for it, and take by force what is refused us when
we ask for it. Besides, even though we are not strong
enough to take the Government by force, we only have
to get up a row, and start some sort of revolution, and
ask the British Government to step in, and of course
England will say to your President, “You cannot keep
the peace, we will have to come and keep it for you,”
and the trick is done, <i>wacht een beetje</i>.’</p>

<p>Such reasoning disgusted Steve, as I am sure it would
many an honest and fair-thinking Englishman. However,
he replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘All I can say is that, if England does this, her glory
shall pass away from her; such injustice will be tolerated
by neither God nor man, and England shall raise such a
cry of shame as has never been heard before. She shall
feel something like the man who opened a hive of
angry bees, and when the bees are stinging and buzzing
about his ears, she shall be sorry she ever opened that
hive. But I must say I have more faith in the honour
and justice of your countrymen than you seem to have.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>Such discussions as these were the order of the day,
and the sample given above may be taken as a fair
example of the opinions of the two parties in the country.
We shall leave the debaters now, but on some future
occasion we shall take advantage of the privilege of
historians to visit them again.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="medium">A HUNTING WE GO</span></h3>

<p>After a few years stay in Pretoria, Steve and his four
special friends made up a party for a sort of picnic and
shooting expedition combined.</p>

<p>They procured a roomy Cape cart and four horses,
laid in a stock of tinned provisions for three weeks, and
started one sunny morning in August.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day, and our friends enjoyed the
sunshine and fresh air greatly, after their long confinement
in town and office. Steve’s cousin, as usual, took
a leading part. He was driving. After a halt for breakfast
and again for dinner&mdash;which was doubly relished
for being partaken of in the open air&mdash;they went on
at a good pace, so as to arrive in time, before dark set in,
at a certain farm, the owner of which was known to
Steve.</p>

<p>‘Well, I declare this is grand,’ remarked Steve as he
lay back in the cart, comfortably settled and puffing
away contentedly at his pipe. ‘I do enjoy driving at a
good pace, with the wind fanning your chin&mdash;oh&mdash;ah&mdash;her&mdash;goodness
gracious, where are we going to? I must
remark here, and at once, that I <i>don’t</i> enjoy a journey to
the centre of the earth, where you seem to be taking us,
cousin mine. What in the name of goodness do you
mean by driving us in here?’</p>

<p>‘But I am in the path.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>‘My dear fellow, don’t you know that when you come
to a place like this, the farther you are out of the path
the safer you are? Let me instruct you now, once for
all, that while you are driving this company, when you
come to a black-looking, soft, soapy, muddy hole like
this, turn out of the path, and cross where you see the
longest grass, and if a cart or waggon has never ridden
there before so much the better.’</p>

<p>For the benefit of the reader, who is unacquainted
with Transvaal roads, we will describe the sort of ‘black,
soft, soapy, muddy hole,’ as Steve called it. In certain
patches of the country stretches of a black, soft soil are
found, something like what, I imagine, an Irish bog to be
from descriptions that I have read of it. When rain has
not lately fallen, it is hard and firm enough, but where
a stream runs through it, <i>then</i> you have to be careful.
Those who know what they are about, generally take
good care to cross where no one else has crossed before,
and where grass is growing, where the grass itself and its
roots form a pretty safe bridge across. But where
waggons or carts have been in the habit of crossing, the
grass and roots have been cut up, down you go, horses
and all, up to the nave and over. In just such a hole
our young hunters now found themselves. The horses
were up to their bellies in the soft mud, and could find
no foothold to work themselves and the cart out. The
cart itself was simply floating on the mud, the bottom of
the cart lying like a boat on it, while a little of it ran in
and blackened the tan-coloured shooting boots of the
occupants. What were they to do now? To leave the
cart meant a mud bath, and such mud!&mdash;black, sticky,
oily mud!</p>

<p>I am afraid they would have made up their minds to
spend the night in their uncomfortable position; but
always when danger seems to be greatest, help is near at
hand.</p>

<p>Fortunately for them, they were in sight of the farmhouse
where they intended spending the night; and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
kindly old Boer and his two sons were soon seen coming
along with half-a-dozen oxen yoked to a long chain.</p>

<p>The chain was soon fastened to the harness of the
leaders, which the rescuers could just reach, and the
oxen pulled out cart and horses. But what a state they
were in; the nice tan-coloured harness was painted black
as far as the mud reached, so were the horses and cart.
But fortunately night was coming on, and the entry of
the visitors to the <i>werf</i> did not look so disreputable as it
otherwise would have done.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="medium">A BOER AND HIS FAMILY</span></h3>

<p>The farmhouse at which our young friends arrived in
such an unclean state, was a really fine villa, had only
lately been built, and was as comfortable and commodious
as any town-built villa, and as good looking too.
A verandah surrounded the house, affording a shady seat
at any time of the day; a convenience which is greatly
valued in this country, especially in December and
January, when it is too hot and close to remain indoors
with any sort of comfort.</p>

<p>The rooms inside were comfortably furnished, each
spare bedroom being provided with a feather bed, wash-hand
stand, chest of drawers, surmounted by a mirror,
and a couple of chairs. Of course the bedroom of the
father and mother of the house was the bedroom <i>par
excellence</i>, and was furnished in style. The dining-room
possessed an expanding dining-table and a suite of
morocco covered chairs, also mahogany sideboard, and
a few pictures&mdash;sea views&mdash;mounted in gilded frames,
adorned the walls.</p>

<p>But the room on which the most money and care had
been lavished was the sitting-room. An upright piano in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
one corner faced an American organ in the opposite
corner; a thick carpet covered the floor, on which was
distributed a satin-covered drawing-room suite and table
to match; a whatnot and book cabinet occupied the two
corners not filled by piano and organ; innumerable
vases, ornaments and nick-nacks completed the decorations,
as far as the furniture was concerned. As to the
walls, they were reserved for the family portraits&mdash;grandfathers
and grandmothers, both paternal and maternal&mdash;fathers
and mothers ditto; and then came two grand life-size
portraits of the present head of the family and his
wife, flanking a family group of the whole existing
family.</p>

<p>The house overlooked a fine valley, through which
flowed a rivulet of bright clear water, from which was
irrigated the grand orchard and ornamental trees which
occupied the whole stretch of ground lying between the
rivulet and the house. This orchard was the pride and
care of the mother of the house, who was assisted by a
‘Cape boy’ (bastard), who in turn was assisted by two or
three Kaffirs in the care of the orchard. She had taken
particular pride in ordering fruit trees and vines of the
best and latest varieties, as well as roses and flowering
shrubs and ornamental trees, such as her neighbours had
never seen before, from the Cape and Natal. Of course,
the father of the house had enough to do, even with the
assistance of the sons, in looking after the numerous
lands lying lower down the fertile valley, and then he
had the care of the large herd of cattle and sheep
grazing on the surrounding hills; besides which cares,
he had lately been busy planting timber and fodder
trees. Lately he even had to do without the assistance
of his two sons, as one was studying for some profession
in Edinburgh and the other at Bloemfontein, O. F. S.,
while he himself had lately been elected a member of
the Volksraad, and was thus obliged to spend four
months of the year in town, assisting at the council of
the nation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>This particular farmer had not always been so well off
as now. When he first married he had this farm&mdash;inherited
from his father&mdash;a couple of hundred sheep, a
dozen or so of cows, a waggon, and one span of oxen.
He and his wife went to live on this farm with no
capital whatever to work this uncultivated and houseless
farm. He set to work, built a <i>hartebeest house</i> (mud
house), composed of three little rooms&mdash;kitchen, dining-room
and sitting-room combined, and a little bedroom.
Together they worked and economised, saving every
penny they could, made <i>kraals</i>, planted trees, sowed
the lands, made irrigation furrows, and tended their
flock of sheep, until they got fairly well off and saved
enough even to buy another half farm adjoining theirs.</p>

<p>The discoveries of gold came, gold was found on the
lately bought half farm, and was sold for £20,000
cash, with a quantity of shares in the company buying
it. Thus prosperity came, and our former struggling,
hard-working Boer, who had to put his own shoulder to
the wheel and work hard himself, if he wanted anything
done, could take matters easy and enjoy himself.</p>

<p>What did he do now&mdash;live on the fat of the land and
let others do the work? No. Just here I want to point
out a peculiarity which I have noticed in our Dutch
farmers in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>In the boom for gold farms, many a formerly struggling
farmer has suddenly found himself a rich man, selling his
farm, or one of his farms, for from £10,000 to £100,000
or more, and yet, amongst them all, I do not know
of one of them that has given up his former simple
mode of life and leads a retired easy life. They may
build a larger, finer and more comfortable house, furnish
it better, be more lavish in their hospitality, but
their former occupation is never given up. Still they
sow their lands, still they tend their flocks, still the
season’s yield of wool is taken to town, and from the proceeds
thereof the household requirements are provided.
A progressive farmer will spend some of his thousands to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
improve his farms, his implements and his stock, but his
occupation is kept, with few exceptions. Even members
of the Government, who formerly farmed, keep their
farms going, visiting them now and then, even though
they could not attend to them themselves. Even so with
the particular farmer we have been describing. His
wealth increased his responsibilities and cares, but in
nowise decreased his work.</p>

<p>We have given this description of a farmer of the
wealthier classes; we would give his name, but it would
serve no purpose, it might only displease him, as he, in
common with most of his race, dislikes publicity. Let it
suffice that the description given is from life.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="medium">A TALK ON BEES</span></h3>

<p>Steve and his friends were received with the greatest
cordiality; first, because Steve was known to the family
and liked by them, and secondly, because hospitality is
natural&mdash;in fact, seems born in a Boer. You will arrive
at a farmhouse&mdash;poor or rich&mdash;you are one of the so-called
hated nation&mdash;a <i>rooi nek</i> (nickname given to
Englishmen because their tender skin causes their necks
to blister and turn red in the hot South African sun,
literally meaning ‘red nek’)&mdash;unknown; at the door
you meet a youngster just able to talk. You will dismount.
This premature young man will come up to
you with an air of&mdash;<i>playing the host</i> about him, will
take hold of your hand, give it a shake, and say,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Wil Oom nie afzaal nie?’ (Will uncle saddle off?)</p>

<p>Yes you will.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, uncle can walk just right in and have a
cup of coffee; I will see to the horse.’</p>

<p>Well, as I said, our young friends were well received,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
and soon found themselves seated around a supper table,
as well laid and as well provisioned as man’s heart could
desire in such a locality. Roast beef, stewed guinea-fowl,
leg of venison, stuffed with bacon and baked vegetables,
salads, etc., custard pudding, blanc mange, fresh
butter, cheese, etc., washed down with coffee, and such
coffee as only a <i>Tante</i> knows how to brew, and that Java
coffee too. After supper, the party adjourned to the sitting-room,
where they were soon followed by the <i>Tante</i>,
after she had seen to the servants getting their food, and
the remnants of the supper had been safely put away.</p>

<p>‘Now, Stephaans,’ said she to Steve, ‘you or your
friends must come and look at a bee-hive that a <i>winkelier</i>
(shopkeeper) made me buy in town last week. It is one
of those new-fangled patent things. Its inside is full of
pieces of wood&mdash;goodness only knows what for. They
say it is better than just an empty box for the bees. I
don’t understand it. Do you or any of your friends
understand it?’</p>

<p>Now Steve saw a chance to distinguish himself in the
way he liked to do&mdash;by being useful. Apiarian books
had been among his favourite studies, so he knew all
about it, having always kept one or more hives for study
and also for&mdash;honey.</p>

<p>‘Well, <i>Tante</i>, if you will send for the hive, I shall
explain all about it to you.’</p>

<p>The hive came, and Steve surprised even his companions
by the learned dissertation he gave on bees and
bee-keeping. He surprised the simple old gentleman and
his lady almost into disbelief, when he told them the
queen was the mother of all the bees in the hive; that
she was only a fully developed female bee, reared from
the self-same egg from which the worker bee is raised, and
that she is only made a queen by over feeding and by
giving her more space to grow out in in the cell. That the
drones, or, as they called them in Dutch, <i>water-carriers</i>,
are not water-carriers, but that they are, in fact, great,
lazy, good-for-nothing male bees, who love to live on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
what the females earned in the fields, and absolutely
refuse to do any work (as so many of their sex, even in
the human race, delight to do); that, in fact, they were
unable to do any work&mdash;not being built that way; but were
only called into existence to be husbands to the young
queens, which may be raised during the season for the purpose
of sending out swarms, and thus obey the command
of the Creator when He said, ‘Go forth and multiply.’</p>

<p>But their surprise reached its climax, when he told
them that he could make the bees manufacture a queen
for themselves, should they be queenless, by simply
giving them eggs or larvæ to make her from; that, in
fact, he could force them to make as many queens to his
order as he liked by simple manipulation, and that he
could thus make three or four swarms of bees out of one
in a season. He tried to explain to them all this, and
by explaining the why and the wherefore, he soon got
them to believe and understand him. He also showed
them how to fix and wire the wax foundation in the
frames, and thus spare the poor bees a lot of work; also
told them how, by the use of an extractor, they could extract
all the honey from the combs without breaking the
comb, and thus save the bees the time and expense of
wax to rebuild it. ‘All you have to do is to replace the
empty comb in the hive, when the bees refill it.’</p>

<p>The Oom and Tante were especially pleased when it
was explained to them that by the use of the modern
hive they were spared the cruel necessity of destroying
any of the young bees or brood, when taking the honey
out, or, as it is truthfully called, <i>robbing the hive</i>, and that
the honey reserved for the use of man was pure, without
young bees or pollen (bee bread).</p>

<p>From bee-keeping the conversation drifted to gardening,
vegetable and flower, as well as fruit culture, in all of
which Steve was an adept. He told the Tante of so many
new modes of grafting and pruning, that she exclaimed
he talked like a book.</p>

<p>In this way it happened, that Steve gained the friendship
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
and respect of all the country people he came
across. He could talk to them of things they understood
and which interested them&mdash;matters concerning
their everyday life.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<span class="medium">GOOD SHOTS</span></h3>

<p>After a good night’s rest and a hearty breakfast, our
friends once more resumed their journey, being anxious
to get farther away from town, where there would be a
greater probability of getting something to shoot at.</p>

<p>About three o’clock in the afternoon they reached
another acquaintance of Steve’s, and were received with
an almost effusive welcome.</p>

<p>The family consisted of Oom Ignatious, Tante Letta,
Ignatious, junior, eldest, Daniel, second eldest, and Lettie,
junior.</p>

<p>Oom Ignatious (pronounced Ignaas) was a spare,
slightly grey old man, with a slight stoop in the shoulders,
partly from hard work and partly from a weak chest.
He was a kindly old man, uneffusive, but always had a
smile and a kindly word for friend or enemy. He never
lost his temper&mdash;at least, not visibly, whatever his inward
feelings might be; when annoyed he hardly showed it.
He always remained civil and kind, but was ever firm
and strong in upholding what he considered right.</p>

<p>Tante Letta was fat, fair, and forty. Her estimated
weight was three hundred pounds. She had never been
weighed; when asked, she objected on the ground that
it was only desired to ‘<i>drijf de spot met mij</i>’ (to make a
laughing-stock of me). But with all her weight she was
a good old soul. Everybody loved the old lady for her
goodness. She could never do enough for you to show
her hospitable inclinations. She was always bustling about,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
causing wonder and surprise to all how she could remain
on her feet all day in spite of her great weight. When
you did manage to persuade her to sit down and have
a chat, she simply charmed you with her kindly, smiling,
fat, double-chinned face.</p>

<p>The two sons were both big giants of young men,
straight as a die, broad-shouldered, deep-chested,
healthy-looking and strong, handsome in face and figure,
with curly light brown hair, clean-shaven cheeks, but
wearing light handsome moustaches. Finally, as to
moral character, they were their father and mother’s
children in deed as well as name. But little Lettie was
the angel of the house. I can’t describe her with
sufficient power to place her before the reader as I knew
her. I will attempt, but I know it will be a failure, and
will give the reader only a bare idea of her looks. Tall,
slender, with a graceful willowy carriage, what a poem
in her walk, in her every movement and look! What
sweetness in those large star-like eyes, gleaming like dark-coloured
diamonds under the long-lashed eyelids. The
lines of the face, the shape of nose and chin, I cannot
describe, I simply give in; I know not to what style it
belonged; I only know they were&mdash;<i>Beautiful</i>. The
mouth I can and will describe. <i>It was made to kiss.</i>
The long hair was worn loose, and flowed in waves
down to the waist in a dark, massive cloud. The dress
was a loose, simple gown, fitting the form sufficiently
close to show the perfections of the figure; smart
costumes would only mar such a figure.</p>

<p>Steve will never forget the walk he took alone with
Lettie to the flower garden that afternoon; to him she
was the fairest flower that ever he had seen.</p>

<p>Reader! to prevent any future disappointment, I
must here state that Lettie is not going to be the
heroine of this story; that Steve is not going to marry
her, or even to fall madly in love with her. He admired
and liked her, but after this visit she passes out of his
life; we shall hear no more of her. I have tried to place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
her before the reader as I still see her in my mind’s eye,
as a type of the better class of Boer girls, whose figure has
not been spoiled by bad taste and knowledge of dressing,
and, alas, by hard work too. For many a poor
farmer is obliged to help himself with the labour of his
girls for want of servants; and thus their shoulders
become bent through constant stooping and hard work,
and their figures spoiled and ruined.</p>

<p>I have been told of a certain farmer who ploughed,
sowed and reaped his lands with the aid of four girls;
while one tended the sheep, one the oxen, one led, and
one drove the span of oxen pulling the waggon. And
thus he had to do all his work with only the assistance
of his daughters. He had been blessed with a troop of
girls, and not one boy. And as to native labour, since
the gold mines are offering such high wages, the poor
farmer must consider himself lucky if he can get any at
all; while many cannot afford to pay a price sufficiently
high to keep their boys from going off to the gold mines.
Thus it is that we see so many ill-figured Boer girls.
But for all that, I do believe that amongst the Boer
women are to be found some as handsome as any in
the world. The faint attempt at a description of Lettie
is not drawn from the imagination, but is exactly as she
was known to the writer.</p>

<p>It was amongst this family that our party of hunters
now found themselves.</p>

<p>As I have said, they were welcomed most heartily, their
horses were soon stabled and themselves led into the
house and refreshed with coffee and cake.</p>

<p>Oom Ignatious, not having had the luck as yet to sell
a gold farm, had to content himself with a moderate-sized
farmhouse of the old Dutch style, mainly built by
himself and friends. It consisted of a dining-room, hall
and sitting-room combined (nothing unusual), three bedrooms&mdash;one
bedroom for the old people, one for Lettie,
and one for the boys&mdash;and a kitchen&mdash;five altogether.</p>

<p>Oom Ignatious’s wealth consisted of his oxen and sheep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and in what he managed to raise from his lands, on all of
which he contrived to live comfortably without any waste
or want, but without having much surplus over at the end
of the year.</p>

<p>When Oom Ignatious heard that they were out for the
purpose of killing something, he told Ignatious, junior,
and Daniel to leave the work they were at and show them
the haunts of certain <i>oribe</i> and steenbuck that they
knew of.</p>

<p>Our party of greenhorns failed to bag anything in spite
of repeated attempts. The young Boers showed them
buck after buck quietly grazing in the long grass, but,
standing or running, our young friends missed every shot.
At last Keith said, ‘These young fellows are laughing at
us, the bucks are too far away, you can’t hit them at such
a distance.’ The young Boers, who knew a few words of
English, understood this, but said never a word, and kept
on making themselves as agreeable as possible to Keith
with their scant knowledge of English.</p>

<p>At last, they were on their homeward way, no game in
their bags, when suddenly Ignatious pulled Keith by the
arm, enjoined silence, and pointed to a distant rise in the
level plain and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Do you see that <i>oribe</i> lying there against the butt?’</p>

<p>‘Where? I do not see anything but grass.’</p>

<p>‘There, don’t you see where I am pointing?’</p>

<p>‘No, old chappie, you do not come it over me, there is
nothing there.’</p>

<p>‘Well, give me your gun.’ He had left his gun at home
not to spoil the sport of their guests.</p>

<p>Keith gave him the gun with the remark that it was
only a waste of ammunition. Ignatious knelt on one knee
and rested his arm on the other, took aim and fired, something
bounded in the air at the spot pointed out and fell
down again and nothing more was seen. Ignatious quietly
handed Keith his gun back and led the way towards the
spot. Daniel was holding Steve’s gun in his hand admiring
the workmanship of it, when, as they approached the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
spot, a buck was seen running from it. Everyone shouted,
‘There it goes,’ and ran in a slanting direction as if to intercept
it when a shot was heard. Once more the buck
bounding into the air several feet, fell down to rise no
more. It was Daniel who had fired this time and killed
the buck on the run. They went towards it, cut it up,
took out the intestines and shouldered it, when Ignatious
said, ‘Now let us go and get the other one.’</p>

<p>‘Which one?’ said Keith.</p>

<p>‘Why, the one I shot.’</p>

<p>‘But this is the one you shot at?’</p>

<p>Ignatious laughed quietly and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘The one I shot will never run again; I shot him just
behind the shoulder.’</p>

<p>Keith stared at him and thought he was being fooled
again, so did not say anything more, but followed
Ignatious, only to be led to a dead <i>oribe</i>, shot dead
through the heart&mdash;the bullet had penetrated the buck
just behind the shoulder, as Ignatious had said he
intended it to do.</p>

<p>Keith thought to himself, ‘I wish I could fire a shot
like that, and be as sure of it too. Why, it was three
hundred yards away if it was one.’</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="medium">ANOTHER TRY</span></h3>

<p>After a pleasant evening and a good supper, our
party went to bed, Steve and Theron occupying the
bed of the old people, while Harrison, Steve’s cousin
and Keith took possession of the boys’ room; those
who were thus ejected, satisfying themselves with a
<i>shake down</i> on the floor of the dining-room and kitchen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
respectively. At whatever sacrifice, the guests must be
made comfortable!</p>

<p>It had been arranged that the visitors should have
another try at those <i>oribe</i>, but this time under the
guidance of the old man himself, as the young men had
arranged to leave after breakfast for the <i>kerk plaats</i>
(farm on which a church is built, and where periodical
services are held).</p>

<p>They would have stayed to oblige their guests, but
two fair ones expected them there; the arrangement had
been made to meet there, and even the claims of
hospitality could not induce them to disappoint two
loving hearts.</p>

<p>Everyone on a farm is too busy before breakfast to
go shooting; the sheep had to be counted out of the
kraal and sent to the veld, cows had to be milked,
and all the work of the farm had to be set going and to
be seen to first; therefore the party could not leave till
after breakfast for the veld.</p>

<p>Ignatious and Daniel had to ride out to an outlying
station before starting for their own particular trip.
After breakfast, Steve was standing talking on the stoop
to Lettie, waiting for his party to get ready. Ignatious
and Daniel had just saddled their horses, and were
saying good-bye to Steve and his party, as they would
very likely be still away when Ignatious and Daniel
returned from the out station, when they would immediately
leave for the <i>kerk plaats</i>.</p>

<p>‘What fine fellows these brothers of yours are,’ remarked
Steve to Lettie. ‘You ought to be proud of
them.’</p>

<p>‘So I am. I only hope that if ever I marry, I may
get a man as good as they are for a husband.’</p>

<p>‘Daniel is going to get married soon, is he not?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, within three months, probably. Do you think
he looks sickly, or unhealthy?’</p>

<p>‘No; on the contrary, I think he looks remarkably
healthy and strong. Why do you ask?’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>‘Because, a few days ago, I came into his room; he
was looking at the photo of his intended; tears were in
his eyes. I asked him, “What is the matter?” He replied
that he loved her so much, and that yet she
would never be his wife. “What! never your wife!” I
said, “and you are going to be married in a few months
to her; what do you mean?” He replied that <i>he felt it
in his heart</i>; he did not know why, unless <i>he should die
before the time came</i>. And then he told me that I was
to take his Bible, if he should die, and his sweetheart
his new hymn book, and other things he told me to give
to mother and father, as well as something for Ignatious.
The foolish boy, as if he were going to die so soon; the
idea is ridiculous; and yet, if he should die, I don’t know
what we should do without him.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you need not fear for him, he is strong and
healthy enough to outlive us both.’</p>

<p>No more was said, and Steve did not think much of
what was said, but he had reason sooner than he could
have thought, to recall this conversation.</p>

<p>At last they started, and all hoped to have better luck
than the day before. Steve was a fairly good shot at a
target, in fact he was (like most South Africans) a born
shot; but he had never had a chance to practise rifle
shooting at a distance at real game, but he was a good
hand at bird shooting with a shot-gun. Ever since he
was a boy of twelve, he used to scrape his pennies together
to buy powder and shot, and go pigeon-shooting
with an old muzzle-loading shot-gun, which had formerly
belonged to his father, and a good hand he learned to
be at it by such practice. It was one of the few kinds
of sport he enjoyed; he loved shooting. For the above
reasons, Steve longed to bring down a real antelope of
some kind, but he was doomed to disappointment.
The game was too shy, and kept at a distance, requiring
a really good shot to bring them down. Theron
was the only one to kill that day. After a long walk in
the hot sun and among the trees, Theron succeeded, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
taking a good steady aim (and being told what sight to
put on by Oom Ignatious) at a buck standing broadside
on, unaware of their presence, in bringing it down. Oom
Ignatious refused to shoot, as he said he did not like to
spoil their sport, but inwardly he thought that, after the
previous day’s occurrence&mdash;of which he had been told by
Steve&mdash;it would be too unkind to humiliate the poor
young greenhorns by a display of his accurate aim, for
he knew that with him to shoot was to kill. The sun
was hot and heavy, thunder-clouds were beginning to
rapidly cover the sky, so it was determined to return
home as fast as possible before the heavy storm, which
was surely coming on, broke on them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<span class="medium">A TERRIBLE THUNDER STORM</span></h3>

<p>Reader, have you ever taken note of the signs of a
heavy African thunder storm coming on? Have you
felt the awful depressing heat, which seems to make the
heart feel too faint and languid to beat? Have you
noted the awesome, mysterious twilight that seems to
settle over the earth? A moment everything appears to
be alive and joyous; birds are singing, cattle bellowing,
all nature murmurs a pæan of gladness for <i>life</i>. In another
moment everything seems to hide itself and hush its
breath. Not a murmur is heard, not a leaf rustles, not
a breath of wind is felt. It is the calm before the storm.
Now the suspense seems to be agonising; it gets darker
and darker. Suddenly the leaves seem to rustle out of
very fear, as if they longed to break the silence, for they
rustle, and yet not a breath of wind is felt. Then gradually
you hear an ever-increasing roar at a distance. My God!
what a crash is that! It is the first clap of thunder that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
breaks over your head, seeming to strike near you, all
around you; you feel that you are not safe, you long for
shelter, for company, for somebody to share your terror.
Such a thunder storm seems to make cowards of the
bravest. It is an invisible enemy; an irresistible danger
seems to threaten you, to surround you, to search you
out, hide where you will. If you never prayed before,
you feel as if you would like to pray now. Deny it if
you will, hide it if you might, look as brave as you can,
yet I tell you you <i>do</i> feel awed when the thunder of
heaven seems to speak to you with the voice of an
angry God.</p>

<p>After that first clap, the silence is broken, the storm
is on you. Clap after clap of thunder strikes around
you. The lightning seems to blind you. The trees
bend to the ground before the great force of rushing air,
and those that will not bend must break, and come
crashing down, crushing everything underneath them,
and obstructing the paths and roads.</p>

<p>The rain seems to come down, not in drops, nor in
sheets either, but in one continuous mass. You can
hardly draw your breath because of the wind and rain;
and in a moment you find yourself wading in six inches,
ten inches, twelve inches of water on the level plain.
Woe to the flock of sheep that finds itself in the least
hollow or depression between two butts or rises of the
rolling plain. They are drowned where a few moments
before they stood on dry veld, seemingly safe against
any flood. Such was the storm our friends found themselves
in now. They could do nothing but pull their
hats over their eyes and plod and wade wearily along.
Wet to the skin in a moment, their clothes clinging most
uncomfortably to them, the house seeming to recede
farther and farther away as they struggled on; even the
much-prized buck which Theron had shot was dropped
and left lying in the veld. Their only desire was to get
home; to get at least a roof between themselves and
this terrible thunder.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>Thank God, it is passing over at last. It did not last
long, but while it did last it was terrible!</p>

<p>Now it gets lighter and lighter. The blue sky peeps
out gradually larger and larger on the western horizon&mdash;the
direction from which the storm had come&mdash;at last,
even the sun comes out again. And everything peeps
forth again. The lambs begin to play, the calves gallop
and frolic about, the birds sing merrier than ever; and
the trees&mdash;they can only weep tears of joy that the
cruel wind does not bend them down so cruelly any
more. Now the storm is raging towards the east, its
distant rumbling is heard, and the clouds look piled up
in black and blue masses in that direction.</p>

<p>Now our party is able to walk again; the water has
gathered in the hollows and rivulets. By choosing high
ground, progress can be made.</p>

<p>They were nearing the house when they saw a man
approaching towards them in a slanting direction. What
can be the matter with him? Surely such a storm was
sufficient to sober the most intoxicated man on earth?
And yet this fellow must be drunk. See how he
staggers; sometimes he drops on to his knees, and
clasps his head between his hands, and even at this
distance they can hear him sob as if his heart was
breaking. He rises once more, sees them approaching
now near by, he cries out aloud, stretches his arms towards
them in a supplicating manner. They hear the
agonising words escape from him. Oh, my brother?
The old man turns as pale as death. He recognises his
eldest son, as did the rest. Oom Ignatious rushes forward;
he reaches his son just as he drops down in a
dead faint. His father lifts him, holds him in his lap,
and cries,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Oh, my son, my son, what has happened? Oh, my
God, see how he is scorched! Oh, horrible, his clothes
are crumbling as if burnt; his skin comes off. Oh, my
God, have pity upon a poor father, and spare my
son.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>The young man opens his eyes once more and murmurs,
‘My brother, my brother,’</p>

<p>‘Where is your brother, Ignatious?’</p>

<p>‘Over there,’ he replied, pointing to a round hill commanding
the rest of the valley.</p>

<p>‘I’ll go to him,’ said the old man. ‘Is he hurt,
too?’</p>

<p>‘No, father, you must not go. Steve will go with his
friends. You must go with me to mother to prepare her
for the terrible tidings.’</p>

<p>‘What terrible tidings? Ignatious, that you are
wounded?’ queried the old man.</p>

<p>‘No, father. I am terribly scorched, but I may yet
recover; but poor Daniel&mdash;oh, my father, that I should
live and he die when we were side by side.’</p>

<p>‘What&mdash;dead!&mdash;dead!&mdash;my Daniel dead? You cannot
know what you are saying; you are delirious from
your wounds.’</p>

<p>‘No, my dear father, I fear me he is dead. Take
courage; you must be strong and help us to comfort
mother; come.’</p>

<p>The old man seemed to make a strong effort, rose and
helped to raise Ignatious.</p>

<p>‘You are right, my son. Your mother must be our
first care; come.’</p>

<p>He begged Steve, with tears in his eyes, to go and find
Daniel while he went home with Ignatious, who could
scarcely stand.</p>

<p>‘I will send a cart or waggon at once to bring him
home, if you will only wait there and do unto him as
if he was your own dead brother.’</p>

<p>Steve and his four companions went, and what a sight
met their eyes!<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<span class="medium">’TIS THE WILL OF GOD</span></h3>

<p>The hill on which they found themselves was the
highest point of the rolling plain. On it were scattered
masses of ironstone. Whether there was any kind of
metal present in the soil of the hill, or whether it was
because it was the highest spot in the neighbourhood,
Steve could <i>not</i> determine, but he later on learned
that this was a favourite spot for the lightning to strike
down on.</p>

<p>What they saw was this&mdash;</p>

<p>Two horses, dead and all twisted up as if they had no
bones in their bodies, indescribably horrible to see. Entangled
with one horse, a man’s body was seen. When
they lifted him up by the arms, his head dropped backwards
between the shoulders, as if his neck was composed
of only skin and soft flesh. His hat and most of his
clothes were carbonised, and his flesh, where exposed, was
scorched and burnt in crooked lines. But let us draw
a curtain, ’tis God’s work; His ways are inscrutable.</p>

<p>The body was conveyed, in a waggon (sent for the
purpose), home.</p>

<p>When the body was carried into the house, the mother
of the dead man cast off all restraint and threw herself in
a passion of weeping upon the corpse, and had to be
dragged away by main force from the awful sight of the
mutilated body of her son.</p>

<p>To cut a gruesome story short, the body was buried
the following day at midday. Steve and his companions
came over from a neighbouring farm, where they had
gone the afternoon of the accident, as so many relatives
and friends had come to assist the bereaved family that
they thought it well to leave and relieve the house of the
care of stranger guests.</p>

<p>Poor Ignatious was in a precarious condition; his life
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
was despaired of for some time. But he recovered in
the end. But poor Tante Letta; the shock was too
much for her; she nearly followed her boy to the grave,
and was delirious for months afterwards. Oom Ignatious
spanned in his cart, on the doctor’s advice, and
rode from neighbour to neighbour for weeks, every day
giving his wife change of scene and faces. By this
means, she gradually recovered a shadow of her health
and reason. But the beautiful motherly smile, which
formerly dwelt on her face, was gone for ever. She is
now the tender care of little Lettie, and is waiting
patiently for the time when her God will call for her,
and take her to her beloved son. God comfort the poor
old lady!</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span class="medium">A DANGEROUS FORD</span></h3>

<p>The day of the funeral was Sunday. Steve and party
took leave of the sad household, and the following
day went farther on.</p>

<p>Keith was moved by the kindness and godliness of
the family he had just left. ‘These Boers are not such a
bad and uncivilised people as they are made out to be by
their enemies; in fact, I wish Englishmen were more
like them. What surprises me in them is their quiet,
simple, unboastful manner, and their extreme kindness
to strangers such as I am.’</p>

<p>‘You will find exceptions to every rule,’ Steve replied.
‘You will find boasters and bad people amongst them
as amongst all other peoples. But, as a people, they are
true Christians, leading a life as near as they can to
what their Bible teaches them their lives should be.
Their Bible is their law, and by that standard they act
and judge all things. It is true they have some
prejudices, likes and dislikes, which is to be deplored;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
but even in that they injure no man. They have the
making of a great people in them, and I am proud to
be of their race.’</p>

<p>During the Monday, our friends moved on quietly,
their conversation was hushed, they spoke of serious
matters; and the usual lively and sportive conversation
prevailing amongst a party of young men out by themselves,
was entirely absent.</p>

<p>The road they were travelling ran through a vast
plain, black as night. The fire, prevalent at this season,
had burnt up every blade of grass. The farmers usually
burn the grass down just before the first summer rains
come on, so as to have the grass come out young and
tender for their flocks. And as soon as rain has fallen,
and the grass is growing, they move out of their winter
quarters in the bush veld, and come back to their houses
on the high veld, which, during the winter, are left under
the care of, perhaps, one member of the family, or a
native servant whom they can trust, or is left to take
care of itself.</p>

<p>The party travelled on all day, and came only at
midday to a house, where they could obtain a little
soaked mealies for their horses. All the other houses
they had come to were deserted, as the families were
still in the bush veld, and they had been unable to
procure a mouthful of forage for their horses. They
themselves were all right, for they had a good stock of
provisions, but the poor brutes were starving.</p>

<p>After the feed of mealies, the horses put a little spurt
on again during the afternoon, but soon the want of food
again made itself felt.</p>

<p>The young men began to feel anxious. If the horses
got no food, they could not pull the cart; and to remain
stuck in such a black and uninhabited plain, with no
shelter from the hot sun, would be decidedly unpleasant.</p>

<p>They had been directed to a farm where they would
find good people at home, as well as forage for their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
horses and game for their guns, and were pushing on to
reach this place. But on this bare, black plain many
roads crossed and recrossed. It was a regular network
of roads running from farm to farm. They became
confused as to which road they should take and which
leave. They soon realised the fact that they had lost
their road, and were going at random. The danger now
began to get serious. Their horses were dragging wearily
along, and could scarcely keep up a semblance of a
trot, and would soon give in altogether. The poor
brutes had been in harness most of the day, and that on
a mouthful of mealies only. But what could they do?
They must keep on to reach shelter for themselves and
food for the horses. Night is coming on; ’tis only
twilight now, and twilight does not last longer than thirty
or forty minutes here. Soon they will be unable to see
the road, and will be forced to span out on this barren,
inhospitable veld.</p>

<p>‘Hurrah! I see a light, and what is more, the dim
outline of trees, and I do believe a house,’ cried
Steve.</p>

<p>‘But where the dickens is the road?’ cried his
cousin. The road seemed suddenly to disappear on the
hard, unimpressionable soil. But all jumped down and
went in search of a road.</p>

<p>Going a little forward, they discovered that they were
by no means out of the difficulty yet. A river lay
between them and the light, and what is more no <i>drift</i>
was visible. The banks were steep, and no cart could
pass it, and a deep <i>zee koe gat</i> (wallowing pools of sea-cows)
occupied the whole visible stretch of the river.
They ran up against the stream and soon came to what
appeared to be a sort of <i>drift</i>. But what a <i>drift</i>.</p>

<p>On examination they found it to be an old disused
<i>drift</i> or ford. Wash-aways of one foot to a foot and a
half crossed the steep road, going down into the river.
And in the river itself large round stones three feet high
lay piled up one against the other on the only place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
where a cart might have passed. What were they to do
now? No other <i>drift</i> seemed near. Stay there they
could not, and darkness was settling down on the
land.</p>

<p>They stood looking in dismay at this <i>drift</i>. The
opposite side was not crossed by wash-aways, but
seemed to be almost one large precipice in itself. But
still, with good horses, once there, they might be able
to mount it. But how to get there?</p>

<p>‘Well, I do not see the use of standing talking
here; we cannot stay here&mdash;cross we must&mdash;let us
act!’ said Steve.</p>

<p>‘But we cannot cross here,’ cried Harrison. ‘The
cart would be smashed! So how can we act?’</p>

<p>‘I for one won’t drive through here; my life is not
insured,’ said Steve’s cousin.</p>

<p>‘And I would not remain on the cart if you did,’ said
Keith.</p>

<p>‘Well, undo the leaders and lead them across. I
shall drive the cart over, but with the wheelers only.
They seem to be steady and reliable, and fairly lively
yet,’ said Steve.</p>

<p>The others stared at him, but he remained cool
and calm, as all great natures do in the time of peril.
He started undoing the leaders, as the others seemed in
doubt whether to take him at his word or not, led them
on one side, and handed them to Theron, who seemed
the most collected of the others.</p>

<p>He got on the cart, spoke firmly but kindly to the
horses, took the reins well and strongly in hand, as short
as possible, and started down the precipitous road. When
he got to the first drop or wash-away in the road, he
made the horses climb down first, stopped them, then
moved them forward step by step, holding them hard in
the mouth, until the cart came on the edge of the drop.
When the cart came to the edge, it dropped down, but
gently, as the horses at this moment, pulled back firmly
by Steve, pressed the wheels firmly against the side of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
little precipice, and thus broke the fall, bringing the cart
down with only a slight bump, without injuring it in the
least.</p>

<p>In this way he climbed down all the dangerous drops,
until he came to the river itself.</p>

<p>Here the danger seemed greatest. How to get across
those great, big, round stones? But even across these
he got, foot by foot, inch by inch, making the horses
pull the wheels out against the round sides of the rocks,
and back it down gently on the other side. Thus he
went from rock to rock. Sometimes the wheels jumped
from rock to rock, when they were near enough; sometimes
the cart seemed on the point of tumbling over into
the <i>zee koe gat</i> alongside, when one wheel was on top of a
rock and the other down between two others. But the
worst of all was the feet of the poor tired horses amongst
these great, big, round boulders. Sometimes one or the
other would slip down on its knees, only to be picked
up gently by the firm hand at the reins; sometimes their
feet would stick fast between two rocks, but by moving
only one step at a time, and keeping his horses quiet,
Steve found himself at last in front of the steep wall on
the other side. Now he fully saw how steep it was, and,
worst of all, it was heavy sand. Will the poor, tired
horses ever manage to get out of this hole? Should the
horses lose their footing or give in for a second, when
half-way, the cart would drag them down, and all would
come down in a broken mass&mdash;horses kicking, stones
obstructing&mdash;and, perhaps, the whole would go down into
the <i>zee koe gat</i>, which would mean almost certain death to
the man finding himself entangled in this mass. But
there is no time for hesitating now. He is in, and must
get out. It is nearly quite dark now. After giving the
horses a moment to breathe, he let go the reins, shouted
to them to go, and lashed them until they flew forward
in terror, right against the steep wall. Now they are half-way
up&mdash;my God! they are slipping in the sand! For a
moment they seemed to go down. No! up they go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
again. They pant and bend, but up they go; and at
last, the cart stands on level ground again.</p>

<p>Now only Steve discovers that he is pouring wet; the
sweat is simply running from him. He is trembling all
over from excitement; his mouth is parched. He steps
down, quiets the horses, gets a drink from the water
canteen, and wipes the sweat from his eyes and is himself
again. He is soon joined by his companions, leading
the two other horses. They had been standing looking
on as if paralysed. They expected to see the cart
sink into ruins every moment, and their admiration was
unbounded when they saw him guide the vehicle over
obstacle after obstacle, safe and sound. When they
came up to him, they generously congratulated him, in
unmeasured terms, for his pluck and skill; and, to the
end of their trip, when they came to dangerous places
(which was often enough), they made him take the reins,
to the disgust of his cousin.</p>

<p>Well now, at last they could go to the house they had
seen at a distance. It is true it is dark and no road
visible, but the light still shone and invited them on;
and after such a <i>drift</i> crossed, surely they can find their
way across the level plain, even though it be dark. Steve
led the way on foot, and soon they found themselves in
front of the house they had seen.</p>

<p>But their hopes appeared dashed to the ground again.</p>

<p>‘Seems to me this is a poor show, and it strikes me
we will have to camp outside after all.’</p>

<p>They had come to the poorest of poor houses. A low,
small mud house. It must be one of the poorest farmers
in the district.</p>

<p>The barking of the dogs had brought the inmates out
of the house by this time. The following dialogue took
place.</p>

<p>‘Good evening, Oom.’ (Steve spoke).</p>

<p>‘Good evening, Neef.’ (Nephew).</p>

<p>‘Who lives here, Oom.’</p>

<p>‘I do!’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>‘May I ask Oom’s name?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, young man; my name is Zarl Venter.’</p>

<p>‘Will Oom have a shelter for us to-night.’</p>

<p>‘Young friend, I have never turned a stranger away
from my door, even though I am poor; and hope I
never will. If you are satisfied with the best we have,
which is not much, you are welcome.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Oom; we have food, but we should like
a shelter as it looks like rain, and a little food and
shelter for our horses.’</p>

<p>‘Food and shelter for yourselves, I have already told
you you are welcome to the best we have. As to your
horses, I have no stable, but those big trees are as good
as any stable if it does not rain very much. As to forage,
my son has a little; you must ask him.’</p>

<p>‘We will pay him for it, uncle.’</p>

<p>‘Speak to him yourselves.’</p>

<p>The horses were soon tied up and fed, and our young
men found themselves in a low room, barely furnished,
with a few chairs and a table. Supper was on the table,
and consisted of coffee and bread <i>ad lib</i>, nothing
more.</p>

<p>The young fellows stared at each other. They were
hungry, and only bread and coffee. True, it was nice,
fresh, delicious home-made bread; but bread and
coffee was no supper for a hungry townsman. True
they had plenty of nice tinned meats and fish on the
cart, but on its being suggested in a whisper to Steve by
his cousin, he shook his head. He had no wish to
humiliate the poor old people by bringing food to their
table, after they had offered them the best they had. So
after their frugal meal, they retired to bed. They slept
on the bed of the old couple themselves; who, as Oom
Ignatious and his wife had done, slept on the floor to
accommodate their stranger guests. The son had a little
nest of his own, but one too poor to offer to these city
folks.</p>

<p>The four had to make themselves as comfortable as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
they could on the large double bed of the old people, by
lying crosswise. At any rate, the bed was perfectly
clean.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<span class="medium">A CHANGE OF ROUTE</span></h3>

<p>The party rose early next morning, fed the horses, and
held a consultation. They learned that they had passed
the farmhouse to which they had been directed, far to
the right. They were told by Oom Zarl Venter that
they would find very few people at home on their present
course, as in that direction nearly everybody was in
the bush veld with their cattle.</p>

<p>‘But if you want game, why don’t you go to the bush
veld. There you will find lots of game as well as people.’</p>

<p>‘But it is too far away from here.’</p>

<p>‘Not at all, you can be in the bush veld to-morrow if
you choose, tired as your horses are.’</p>

<p>He further told them that they might go as far as
Mijnheer Stienberg’s place, just this side of Kameelpoort,
and the following day pass through Kameelpoort, when
they would be in the outskirts of the bush veld, and
just in the right place for pheasants and partridge
shooting.</p>

<p>‘But is there no place half-way between this and
Mijnheer Stienberg’s place where we might obtain forage
for our horses?’ asked Steve.</p>

<p>‘Yes, there is a place. Old Silas Prinsloo lives there&mdash;but&mdash;’
and the old man smiled, ‘he is very <i>Kwaai</i>’ (bad-humoured).</p>

<p>‘Too <i>Kwaai</i> to sell us some forage for our horses?’</p>

<p>‘Well, you see, some <i>Smouses</i> cheated the old man
several times, and if you are taken for <i>Smouses</i> (traders
or hawkers), you must look out and get out of his way;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
and he seems to suspect all strangers with a cart laden as
yours is for <i>Smouses</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Well, we will try at all events,’ said Steve.</p>

<p>They set out, well directed as to which roads to take
and which to leave; and after the previous day’s predicament,
took good care to go right.</p>

<p>After several hours’ travelling, they arrived at a house
which, from the description they had heard, they correctly
surmised to belong to Oom Silas Prinsloo. They halted
in front of the door. An old man with a stern countenance
was leaning over the bottom half of the door,
surveying them with a threatening and severe cast of
countenance. He did not speak.</p>

<p>‘Good-day, Mijnheer!’ began Steve.</p>

<p>‘Good day!’</p>

<p>‘Who lives here, Mijnheer?’</p>

<p>‘What has that got to do with you?’ severely.</p>

<p>‘Oh, nothing, Mijnheer. Only I thought Mijnheer Silas
Prinsloo must be living here, who, I have been told,
would be kind enough to sell us some forage for our
horses.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t keep forage for every cheating Jew of a
<i>Smouse</i> who may come to cheat me. You had better
go; I don’t want to buy anything, and my dogs are very
<i>Kwaai</i> (fierce).’</p>

<p>‘We are not <i>Smouses</i>, Mijnheer, we are going to the
bush veld for a little shooting and want to buy a few
bundles of oats for our poor tired horses.’</p>

<p>‘And what may your name be?’ he asked, still
suspecting.</p>

<p>‘Stephaans Joubert, Mijnheer.’</p>

<p>‘From where do you come?’</p>

<p>‘From Pretoria.’</p>

<p>‘Where were you born?’</p>

<p>‘At G&mdash;&mdash;, Cape Colony.’</p>

<p>‘At G&mdash;&mdash;, Cape Colony? That is where <i>my</i> parents
come from, and my great grandmother was a Joubert.
We must be related then, surely?’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>The ice was broken, the old man came out, shook
hands, accepted Keith’s tobacco pouch, filled his pipe,
and assisted to outspan the horses, led the way to the
stable, and, hey presto! the horses were contentedly
chewing plenty of good oats. The party was invited into
the house and coffee brought forth, while poor Steve had
for a full long hour to explain the genealogy of his
house, and hear that of the host explained; and the old
man succeeded in explaining how they were related.
Steve did not exactly understand the conversation, but
from the old man’s use of words, such as cousin in the
third and fourth degree ‘to my grandmother,’ and so
forth, he thought it must be somewhere in Noah’s time
that the relationship commenced. However, as the
pretended relationship helped to feed the horses, he did
not complain. After an hour’s good feed, the horses
were once more inspanned, and, much to Steve’s relief,
his new-found relative was left behind, in spite of urgent
appeals from the said relative to spend the day there.</p>

<p>They arrived early in the afternoon at Mijnheer
Stienberg’s, and were well received by the family. The
old man and his wife were emigrants themselves from
the Cape Colony, and belonged to the most progressive
class of farmers. A good governess was kept for the
boys and girls, and the farm work was carried on progressively
and at a good profit.</p>

<p>The young men enjoyed a real pleasant social evening
with the governess and the girls, who were all good
musicians and had splendid voices. The young fellows,
who all liked music, joined them in several songs, but
enjoyed most to lie back in their easy-chairs and listen
to the fresh voices of the girls singing Dutch and English
ballads and hymns. Thus they occupied themselves until
a late hour, after which they went to bed and enjoyed a
good night’s sleep. An early start was made the next day,
for all were anxious now to reach the bush veld.

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<span class="medium">THE BUSH VELD</span></h3>

<p>After half-an-hour’s travel, Kameelpoort was reached,
and on emerging on the other side, our friends found
stretched out before them hills and valleys covered by
trees and bushes. It seemed to them, as they stood
high above these valleys and hills, that the earth appeared
to sink lower and lower the farther northward they
looked. It was really so. They were standing on a
range of hills separating the high from the low veld.
The high veld is a bare, undulating plain, covered with
grass only. The low veld is covered with bush and
trees, ranging from low dwarf bushes to the high majestic
yellow wood, and other large varieties of trees. The
farther north you go, the lower you descend, and the
warmer it becomes, so that in mid-winter you have a
mild pleasant climate, but in summer only natives and
game can exist.</p>

<p>Under the trees and in the open glades a high, sweet
grass grows&mdash;splendid feeding for cattle and sheep in
winter. Thus it is that all farmers do not consider
themselves well off before they have a farm or two on
the high veld for summer, and a farm in the bush veld
for winter pasturage.</p>

<p>After descending into the valley before them, our party
reached a stream where were encamped about ten
families of farmers, some of whom Steve knew. The
usual welcome was accorded them.</p>

<p>We shall describe the winter quarters of one of these
families, which are all alike more or less, some better
some worse.</p>

<p>If the family has two full tent waggons, so much the
better, then they have two bedrooms ready. In each a
comfortable <i>Kartel</i> (bedstead without legs) is tied, and
a feather bed made on it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>Between the two waggons, one or two tents are
stretched, one serving as another bedroom, and the other
as a dining-room.</p>

<p>In front of the tents and waggons an enclosure is
made of marsh or river reeds. In the enclosure thus
formed, a floor of mud and cow dung is laid, which
makes a smooth, hard floor. On one side of the enclosure
a fireplace is made, being a circle large enough to
contain all the pots of the family, enclosed by a ridge
of mud three or four inches high, to keep fire and ashes
within bounds. This is the kitchen, and also the sitting-room
of an evening, when all would gather round the fire,
and the events of the day would be talked over. This
enclosure is always kept neat and clean.</p>

<p>Steve and his party found a good company of sportsmen
in the community here encamped. As it was still
early, a party was got up to go shooting. They started
about four o’clock.</p>

<p>A good bag was made. We shall relate only one incident
of the afternoon. Steve found himself with the
boaster of the company; he was named William. His
stories of his skill in shooting were marvellous. Steve
was considered by him as a greenhorn, and thus a suitable
party to be stuffed with yarns of miraculous shots
that he&mdash;William&mdash;had at various times made. Steve
listened quietly and thought he should like to see a few
of these accurate shots. They arranged to shoot turn by
turn. The guns were all shot-guns, as they were only
out after partridge, koraan and pheasants.</p>

<p>The first of the two to shoot was William. He got a
fine shot at two pheasants, as they hid themselves behind
a tuft of grass, or thought they did, for they were
still plainly visible. William fired and&mdash;missed. Of
course it was an accident, something the matter with the
gun. Steve’s turn came next; and a good turn he got.
They came to a pool of water; walking quietly up, four
koraan were seen standing in a line. William whispered
to Steve to let him fire, as Steve was sure to miss, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
he would guarantee to bring down, at least, two.
Without answering, Steve took aim and fired&mdash;and
killed all four.</p>

<p>William boasted no more after that in the presence
of Steve.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br />

<span class="medium">ANECDOTES</span></h3>

<p>Steve and William returned home to find the rest of the
party gathered in consultation. Keith had strayed from
his companion and guide, and could nowhere be found.</p>

<p>He had gone in chase of a lot of guinea-fowl, and had
disappeared in the bush, and could not be found again.
He was searched for, and shouted for, but in vain.</p>

<p>The present consultation was to arrange plans to go
in search of him. Steve and William, on their arrival,
were told of the situation, and immediate preparation was
made for a search-party, composed of all the males in the
encampment. They started westward, and after half-an-hour’s
brisk walking, and continued shouting and bell-ringing,
they heard a gun fired to the north. It was
agreed among all present that it was a signal of distress
from Keith. A reply shot was fired to let him know they
were near. The result was a continuous fire of shots
from the direction in which the first shot had been heard.</p>

<p>‘Oh, he is all right,’ said Harrison; ‘he is having a
grand old time amongst the guinea-fowl. He is not lost
after all, he has only been following the guinea-fowl up,
and, I suppose, he has succeeded in driving them into a
corner at last, and is killing them one by one at his
leisure; at least, that seems to be the case from the
number of shots he is firing.’</p>

<p>All laughed, for they understood this to be a joke at
Keith’s expense, for, of course all knew those shots were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
meant to guide them to the lost man, and were by no
means fired at guinea-fowl.</p>

<p>Although a reply shot was fired now and again to let
Keith know that help was coming, he seemed to be
determined to let them know where he was, for he kept
on firing, apparently as fast as he could pull out empty
cartridge cases and put full ones in again.</p>

<p>Guided in this way, they soon came up to the place
where Keith was standing. When they came up he
looked thoroughly disgusted with himself and everybody
else. But he felt <i>awfully</i> glad, as he afterwards expressed
it, to see them. He confessed to having really been
afraid to spend the night in the bush; nameless terrors
came before his mental vision, and, said he, ‘If I felt so
dreadfully lonely and afraid, when I knew I could not be
far away from the camp, what must one’s feeling be to be
really <i>lost</i> in the bush? It must be awful&mdash;ugh!’</p>

<p>‘But how did you manage to lose yourself?’ asked
someone.</p>

<p>‘Well, you can’t understand it before you get lost yourself;
I always thought I would never lose my bearings,
wherever and however situated I might find myself. But
when I had given up the chase of the guinea-fowl, and I
wanted to retrace my steps, I could not for the life of me
determine which way I had come. I was not sure
which way the camp lay, and as the sun had gone down,
I could not say which side was north or south. I
climbed a confounded thorn tree, and after I had
perforated myself with thorns, and got as high as I could,
I was rewarded for my pains by seeing the tops of other
thorn trees, and nothing else. I got down and ran in the
direction in which I thought the camp might lie, and
after running a distance I thought it must lie in another
direction, so I kept running in one direction and
another. I was so excited that the sweat was pouring
off me in streams. At last I was so tired that I thought
I had better sit down and rest, and on a little calm
reflection, I saw that I was a fool for running about in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
this way, and that I was only tiring myself, and probably
running farther and farther away from the tents, so I sat
down and waited.’</p>

<p>‘But I say, Keith,’ chimed in Harrison, ‘how many
cartridges have you left in your belt?’</p>

<p>‘Not one; why do you ask?’</p>

<p>‘And how many guinea-fowl have you killed?’</p>

<p>‘You go and bury yourself!’ retorted Keith, who saw
whither Harrison was leading him, and that he was trying
to raise the laugh against him.</p>

<p>The party returned to the camps, and after a hearty
supper of venison, <i>storm jagers</i> (dough nuts) and fresh
butter, Keith got his spirits back, and joined in the
laugh against himself for losing himself so easily; it was
considered a good joke by the Boers, who could find their
way in the darkest night in the bush and never get lost.</p>

<p>After supper, pipes were lighted, and all the men folks
(as well as some of the younger women folks) of the
whole encampment gathered around the large fire in one
of the largest enclosures to indulge in chat and anecdote.
The fire was glorious. Timber was plentiful. Once the
fire was burning well, two or three tree stumps were put
on, and the fire would keep burning on this solid mass
of fuel till next day.</p>

<p>This gathering just suited Steve. He had been in
such gatherings before, and loved to hear the anecdotes
of the hunting field, as well as the battlefield, told by
grey-headed men around the fire of an evening.</p>

<p>After one tale and another had been told by individuals
of the junior members, Steve turned to one of
the seniors, who was known to be on intimate terms with
President Kruger, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I suppose even the President was fond of hunting in
his younger days, Oom Simon?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, he was a noted lion hunter; I have heard a
story or two of his doings as a lion hunter, but I have
never asked him about the truth of it, so you need not
believe it, but I will relate it to you.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>‘The first was when he and another man were suddenly
attacked by a lion one day. They were both unarmed,
as they did not expect to find lions or dangerous beasts of
prey in the vicinity. The President had his hunting-knife
on his hip, and that was all. Suddenly they nearly
stepped on a lion lying in the tall grass; the lion sprang
up, and before he could get out of the way, the President’s
companion found himself under the lion, with the teeth
of the brute closing in his shoulder.</p>

<p>‘The President sprang to his companion’s assistance,
drew his knife, seized the lion by the throat, and
stabbed him in the heart two or three times. The
lion then let go his hold, and fell dead.’</p>

<p>‘But, uncle, is not that almost an impossible thing
to do, to seize a lion by the throat and stab him to
death.’</p>

<p>‘Under ordinary circumstances it would be almost
impossible, but you must know that when a lion bites
into the flesh of his victim and feels the warm blood
in his mouth, he seems to enjoy it so much that he
always closes his eyes for a few moments, and lies
perfectly quiet to enjoy himself. If you think <i>that</i>
impossible, you might think this still more so. The
President had one day walked far ahead of his waggon
in the hunting field. He had again left his heavy
gun in the waggon. He was standing on a rise,
waiting for the waggon&mdash;coming on far behind&mdash;and
resting, when he saw two lions, a male and female,
coming on full speed towards him from an opposite
direction to the waggon. They were charging direct
on him, the lion in front, the lioness some distance
behind. The President saw it was no time to show
funk and run. To run away on foot meant death.
He did the best thing he could under the circumstances.
He stood up and faced the charging lion,
and looked him firmly and fiercely in the eyes. The
lion came within a few paces of him, then stopped,
looked him in the eyes for a moment or two, hesitated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
for a second, then turned and ran away with his tail
between his legs. The lioness, who had by this time
come up, looked after her flying mate in surprise,
seemingly wondering at his giving his prey up so
easily. Then she looked at the President in a searching
way, as if she sought for the danger which had
driven her mate away. She caught the menacing eye
of the President, stood spell-bound for a moment as if
mesmerised, then turned and followed her lord and
master.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I can well believe that, for I have often heard
that the President possessed the power of mesmerism
in a natural way, although he only seems to exercise
it in an unconscious way. And I believe that if a
man does possess such a power, he ought to, with his
wonderful firmness of will, amounting almost to
obstinacy.’</p>

<p>‘No, I do not think he is obstinate,’ replied Oom
Simon, ‘but he never determines upon anything
unless he is firmly convinced that it is the right thing
to do; and then, when once his mind is made up as
to what is right or wrong, he stands by his opinions
to the end, even if he falls by them.’</p>

<p>‘He must be a religious and serious old man,’
remarked Steve in a way, as if he wished to draw out
old Simon. ‘He never jokes or laughs, it appears
to me.’</p>

<p>‘That is because, I suppose, you only see him in
public. If you see him in private amongst his friends,
especially when travelling, he is very fond of his joke.
He <i>is</i> certainly very religious, he fears his God, and
is a true Christian. But he loves a joke nevertheless.’</p>

<p>‘I remember once we were travelling together. We
were amusing ourselves with conundrums; at last the
President said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘“I will give you a riddle now. There is a kraal built
of high stone walls. A troop of asses wish to get into
that kraal, for the lions are roaring around them, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
safety is to be found in the kraal. How will they get
in? Over the wall they cannot; and through the gate
they may not go. How are they to get inside?” said he,
turning to old Mijnheer van Heerden, a member of our
party.</p>

<p>‘“I know not?” replied Mijnheer van Heerden.</p>

<p>‘“Then you are as stupid as the asses themselves, for
they knew not how to get in either.” Of course Mijnheer
van Heerden had to join in the laugh too. He was
nicely caught, ha! ha! ha!’</p>

<p>‘Talking of being nicely caught?’ said Oom Hendrik,
another senior of the party. ‘I once knew a wild fellow
who always liked to play practical jokes. His name was
Petrus. One day he met a minister, looking gentle,
meek and mild, and also a little green, but looks are
sometimes deceptive, as you will see. He went up to
the minister and said to him, “Mijnheer, do you practice
as well as preach the Bible?”’</p>

<p>‘“I hope so, my friend,”’ was the reply.</p>

<p>‘“The Bible says, ‘If a man should strike you on the
left cheek, turn to him the right cheek, that he may strike
that also.’” And he gave the minister a good slap on
the left cheek. The minister quietly turned the right
cheek to him; he was a little disconcerted at this, but
struck it in a half-hearted sort of way, and said, “Yes, I
see you do practice as well as preach.” But it was the
turn of the minister now, who said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘“Yes, but wait a bit, my friend, the Bible also says,
‘That by the same measure that ye shall measure
others with shall ye also be measured by.’” And the
minister took his coat off, and set to, and gave Petrus
the best thrashing he ever had in his life.’

<span class="medium">LION STORIES</span></h3>

<p>Steve saw that the conversation was drifting out of the
desired channel, so he turned to Oom Simon again, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘But did you ever have a narrow escape from a lion,
Oom Simon?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I had a narrow escape once of being thoroughly
frightened. We had been out for a lion hunt during the
day. We found one, or rather he found us, for the first
we saw of him was when he was mounted on the back of
one of our horses. He had bounded out of a clump of
marsh reeds, and sprung right on top of the horse, fastening
his teeth in the neck of my poor hunting horse. We
shot him. I gave him a bullet behind the shoulder, from
the left, and my brother one through the loins from the
right. We skinned him, and took the skin to camp.</p>

<p>‘That night I was standing near the enclosure, when
one of the boys suddenly threw the lion’s skin close to the
dogs standing near to me. The dogs must have thought
it was a live lion. They howled and growled as they
usually do when a lion is near. And one of them, as
big as the lion himself, was so frightened that he ran
against me in the dark. It was so dark I could not see,
and I thought it must be the lion himself. I can tell
you it took my breath away, I got such a <i>schrik</i> (sudden
fright), and it was some moments before I was sure there
was no lion between my legs, but only a dog.’</p>

<p>‘I got a bigger <i>schrik</i> than that one day,’ said Oom
Klaas, another old man, who had been quiet up till now.
‘I had shot a red buck one day. I hung him up a tree,
in the bush, and went for the waggon to take the game
to the camp. I came back with the waggon following at
some distance, having left my gun at the waggon, as I
had only a short time before left the spot, and did not

expect any lions to be there so soon. Judge of my surprise,
when I came within sight of my game, to see two
lions pulling at it. They saw me, and one ran to the
right. I crept round the bushes in an opposite direction.
I was continually looking round in the direction towards
which I had seen one of the lions go, expecting the other
one would follow in the same direction, so I did not
look in front of me, but always behind, in order to
see him if he should charge me from behind. Suddenly
something ran up right against me, throwing me right on
my back. In a flash I saw it was the other lion, with the
red buck in his mouth; he had gone round by the other
way, and thus came upon me in this unexpected way;
fortunately he had the buck in his mouth. So that he
saw me as little as I saw him, thus the result&mdash;that we
collided in this unexpected way. I can tell you I did
get a <i>schrik</i>. I could just shout, <i>Haai you schelm</i>, as I
lay upon my back. But fortunately for me his mouth
was occupied in holding the red buck, and so he could
not bite, and when the shock came, he was as much
surprised and frightened as I was. He dropped the
buck and fled.’</p>

<p>There was amongst the company an old man, named
Oom Frans (I omit all family names as these reminiscences
are all true; and giving fictitious names will
serve no purpose). This old man had gone through
many vicissitudes. One day he was felling a tree. It
was very heavy. The tree fell and caught four of his
fingers in such a way that withdrawing them was impossible.
He had only one companion with him. Nobody
else was within two days’ journey. His companion could
not move the tree stump a hair’s breadth. What to do
now? He got out his knife and asked his friend to cut
the fingers off. But the man had not the nerve to do
so, and refused his friend’s entreaties to amputate the
fingers. Oom Frans got wild; he lost his temper at such
womanishness. He took the knife and cut his own
fingers off himself. It was his right hand. The writer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
has often shaken that stump of a hand, and wondered at
the nerve displayed by the old man in cutting off four
of his own fingers with an ordinary pocket knife.</p>

<p>This old man now quietly said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I once had a narrow escape from a lion. It is many
years ago now&mdash;’</p>

<p>Here Oom Hendrik interrupted him by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘No, Neef Frans, these young fellows are keeping us
out of our sleep, and we old folks get up early. Stephaans
and his friends are going to stay over to-morrow, I
suppose, as Stephaans himself has had too good success
with the koraan to leave them without another try, and I
expect Mijnheer Keith would like to be revenged on
those guinea-fowl. So you had better postpone your
story, or we shall have no adventures to tell them to-morrow
night. Good-night, all friends,’ and off walked
the old chap, followed by the rest of the party, who had
all been feeling rather sleepy during the last half-hour;
for I can recommend to whoever may read this no better
remedy for insomnia than a tramp after guinea-fowl, or
after a lost chum in the bush.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII<br />

<span class="medium">DANGERS OF THE CHASE</span></h3>

<p>The party took full advantage of their further delay the
following day, and a fairly successful bag was made.</p>

<p>In the afternoon all the farmers who could manage
to get away from the cares of their folds joined them.
Each of the visitors had one or more guides, some of
the junior farmers acting as such, so as to prevent any
more straying or getting lost. A point was agreed upon
where all would meet at a certain hour to compare
notes.</p>

<p>The programme was carried out in full. They all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
met, and after a rest had been taken, and success or
non-success had been communicated, they all left together
to return to the camp.</p>

<p>Suddenly they came upon two men lying under a tree.
At a distance they took it to be two men sleeping in the
veld, but on approaching it was seen that they were
lying in too uncomfortable a position to be sleeping.</p>

<p>An investigation was made, when it was found that
they were dead.</p>

<p>It was an old man of about fifty years of age and a
young man of about twenty years. There was a family
resemblance, which hardly left a doubt of their being
father and son.</p>

<p>‘How can this have happened?’ remarked an old
man, closely examining the corpses. ‘It can hardly be
murder, as I find no wound in them; it might rather be
poison, for see how discoloured their faces look. What
could they have been eating to poison themselves?’</p>

<p>‘They have been eating kambaroo, father,’ said a
young man. ‘See, there is half a bulb lying next to
them.’</p>

<p>‘That is not kambaroo,’ returned the old man, examining
the bulb. ‘This is a poisonous bulb. Nobody
who knows kambaroo would eat this bulb for it. The
poor fellows must have heard of it, or known it very
slightly, to make such a sad mistake. I wonder who
they are!’</p>

<p>‘I know them, father.’ said the young man. ‘I found
the nine sheep we lost last week at their tent. The
sheep had got mixed with theirs in the veld. They are
strangers from the high veld, and nobody knows them
here. Their tent is about an hour’s ride on horseback
from here.’</p>

<p>‘Poor fellows, I am very sorry for them and their
families. Koos, you and Jan go and span in the cart
and take them to their tent; and let the <i>veld cornet</i>
know. If you can do anything for the poor families, do
so, and if necessary, you can stay there till to-morrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
and assist to get ready for the funeral. We shall all come
over to-morrow to see what can be done to help the
widow and orphans.’</p>

<p>This was done, and the party returned to the tents
saddened at the sight; and the old patriarchs took the
opportunity to point out to the younger men how transient
and uncertain life is, and that it behoved them to
be prepared at all times to meet their God.</p>

<p>Supper was partaken of silently and soberly. At the
usual evening service, which few of our genuine old Boers
ever omit, an earnest prayer was offered up for those
who had that day been made fatherless and husbandless.</p>

<p>After supper, when sitting round the fire, smoking, and
drinking coffee, the spirits of the party seemed to rise
sufficiently for Steve to remind Oom Frans of his interrupted
story of the night before.</p>

<p>‘I do not mind telling you the story, Stephaans,’ replied
the old man, ‘but remember we must have no unseemly
hilarity after having met death face to face only a
few hours ago.</p>

<p>‘Well, as I said, it is now many years ago, when one
night the lions attacked our camp and carried away a full-grown
bullock. The next day we went in search of them.
The grass was very high, and we did not see them until
we came right upon them. There were eight of them. I
was in front of our party, and when I sighted the lions,
their leader was in the act of springing towards me. I
fired at him as he jumped, and it turned out afterwards
that it was a most lucky shot, as I had shot his lower jaw
bone away. But the shot did not stop his tremendous
spring, and he came down on top of me. I can tell you I
have seen some heavy bullocks in my time, but I felt, as I
lay under that lion, that he must weigh more than any two
bullocks put together; he felt so awfully heavy as he lay
on me full weight, as if he meant to crush me for disabling
his biting instrument. But I did not know then
that I had shot his jaw away, so I expected every moment
to feel his dreadful teeth closing in on my flesh. But I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
felt glad when I heard several shots, and the lion rolled
off me in his death agony. Thank God that his jaw <i>was</i>
shot away. We shot all eight of those lions that day;
and our cattle had peaceful nights for a long time after.’</p>

<p>‘A lion may be dangerous, especially when wounded
or hungry,’ said Oom Koos, another member of the
community. ‘But you have always at least a chance of
disabling a lion when he is charging you. The most
dangerous animal, however, when infuriated, is a black
rhinoceros. There is no stopping the direct charge of a
black rhinoceros. The most accurate shot from the
front hardly affects him; and woe betide the man who
is charged by him, even a horse can scarcely keep away
from him in the bush.</p>

<p>‘I saw a black rhinoceros once kill a man. We were
tracking the rhinoceros in the bush, and had separated
for the chase, when suddenly I heard a rushing sound in
the bush near by, and a cry for help. I ran as fast as I
could towards the spot, and from behind a stout tree, I
saw the maddened animal actually dancing on his victim.
Poor Neef Piet, he was almost too shattered and soft to
pick up for burial; he had a sad death. I shot the beast
dead, but too late.’</p>

<p>‘It is true a black rhinoceros is dangerous when
wounded, or out of temper,’ said Oom Hendrik, ‘and a
wounded or hungry lion is to be avoided. It is also a
fact that a tiger is to be dreaded more than the last two,
for he is agile and quick, and no coward like the lion. I
will bet that the President will never stare a tiger out of
face; for he gives no time, he simply charges right out,
and almost before you see him. But even a tiger will
hardly attack a man after he has once sprung at him and
missed, unless wounded, in which case&mdash;look out. I
have more than once fallen down flat when a tiger
sprang at me, when he would go right over me, and then
he will just run on, and never think of renewing his
attack. But even this trick requires skill and very quick
movement. I once saw a Hottentot perform this trick.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
He was not quick enough. The tiger caught hold of him
with his claws, just above the eyebrows, as he ducked,
and tore his scalp right over his head, so that it hung
like a cap behind him. We re-covered his bald pate with
the scalp, and sewed it on, after which it grew on splendidly,
leaving just a slight mark where it had been
torn.</p>

<p>‘Well, I say these animals are all dangerous; but I
always managed to escape them safe and sound in my
wanderings and different hunting trips, either by killing
them, or managing to discourage them from following
me, or avoiding them somehow.</p>

<p>‘But has any one of you ever been chased by a
wounded wildebeest? I have been; and you may believe
me, I would rather face any living creature on
earth than a beast like that again. It happened in this
way. We had sighted a troop of wildebeest one afternoon
early. There were four of us. We rode down upon
them and fired. I had killed one of them, when I saw
a fine bull with the best pair of horns I had ever seen on
the head of a wildebeest before. I desired those horns,
and when the herd separated, I followed this particular
bull. The rest of the party each followed a beast of his
choice, thus we were soon separated.</p>

<p>‘I had not followed my fine bull long when I got a
chance for a shot, and wounded him. It was a bad shot.
I had wounded him in the shoulder, just sufficiently to
draw blood without disabling him in the least. I rode off
to one side so as to avoid the charge which I knew
would come. I looked back, and saw the bull was in full
chase of me. I realised my danger. It was not the first
time I had shot wildebeest. I put my horse to the
highest pace I dared amongst the bushes and trees, but
the bull seemed to be able to turn much quicker amongst
the trees than my horse could. I saw my only chance
was to make for the open country. I did so, and when
I had once gained the open veld I soon gained upon my
pursuer. I congratulated myself upon being now safe,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
and was thinking it time to halt again and take a
shot at the bull, who was coming on at full speed,
two hundred yards behind&mdash;for a wildebeest <i>never</i>
gives up a chase while his enemy is still in sight
once he has his temper up&mdash;when my horse trod in a
hole, and threw me over his head as he fell. I fell, but
was uninjured. I ran towards the horse to try and pick
him up, as he still struggled on the ground, lying upon
his left side, when I saw at a glance that his leg was
broken. My gun had flown out of hand, and I could
not see it anywhere as the grass was rather tall.</p>

<p>‘What to do now? Not a tree near, and the bull was
only seventy yards away. I could see his blazing eyes as
he came on towards me. His horns, which had tempted
me so, seemed poised ready to toss me up into the air,
as only a wildebeest knows how. At this moment I saw
a porcupine hole not far away. It seemed large enough
to hold me, and, even though it was not deep, it would
suffice, so long as I could keep out of reach of those
terrible horns. I sprang towards the hole and crept
into it. It was just large enough for me to lie in it,
with my head pressed into a hole a little deeper at one
end and my feet into a similar one at the other end.
The hole seemed to have been originally two holes, with
the intervening wall broken down, but not so deep as the
two original holes. Into these two holes I hung with my
head and feet, while my body was resting on the wall
between, which was broken down just deep enough to
leave my body slightly below the surface of the surrounding
ground. The wildebeest bull was on me. I heard
him snorting and tramping about where my horse was
lying, and by the fall of a heavy body which I heard, I
judged that he had completed the ruin of my hunting
horse by tossing him. Now I heard him come towards
me. I felt his hot breath on my back. What will he
do now? I knew I was out of reach of his horns. Will
he have sense enough to tread on me, and thus revenge
himself by breaking my back? No; he knew a trick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
worth two of that it seemed. What do you think he
did? He started licking me. Any harm in that?
Have you ever seen the tongue of a wildebeest? It
is as rough as a rasp, and as hard as a horn. At first
I did not think much of his scratching my back with his
horny tongue, but he had soon worn through my shirt,
which was the only upper garment I had on at the time.
Oh Lord! what a sensation it was when first his tongue
reached my bare body; it was terrible. But you can
easily feel what it was like by taking a coarse rasp and
rasping your bare body. My God, I shall never forget
that quarter-of-an-hour’s torture I endured that day. It
felt as if he was tearing pieces of flesh out of my bare
back. Soon the blood was streaming down my sides, and
the blood seemed to make him madder than ever. Every
time he tore his tongue through my lacerated flesh a
shiver of horror and pain passed through my body. I
prayed to God as I had never prayed before to let me
die. When the horror and pain became too much for me
to bear, I fainted. If I had not fainted I suppose I would
either have died or gone mad. When I came to myself
I was lying on my side; somebody was pouring water
over me and down my throat. My companions had
looked for me, had discovered my horse and the
maddened bull, and shot the latter. They found me
in the hole where the bull had been standing engaged
in his fiendish work. They thought I was dead. But I
recovered, and lived to dread the sight of a wildebeest.
I have the horns of that brute still to-day at home. I
have been offered £15 for them as they are such a
splendid pair, but I will never sell them, and I will never
risk a single-handed fight with a wildebeest bull again.’</p>

<p>Steve and his companions felt their hair almost stand
on end as they listened to the horrible tale.</p>

<p>‘You were one of our party that day, <i>Neef Frederick</i>,’
said the old man, turning to a companion. ‘Have I
spoken the truth?’</p>

<p>‘That you have, Neef; I could take my oath on it,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
was the reply. ‘And what is more, I one day saw my
uncle killed by just such another wildebeest. We also
had a chase after an old bull. We were three. We
shot and wounded him. He turned and stood at bay, and
chased my poor old uncle, and as he was in a line with
my uncle from us we dared not fire for fear of hitting my
uncle. In a moment he came up to the old man, as his
horse was not very good, and rather slow. He caught
the horse with his horn between the hind legs, and
tossed him forwards, hind legs in the air. As the horse
was tossed forward my uncle dropped backwards, and
was caught upon the horn of the bull. The horn penetrated
just under his chin, in an upward direction, passing
out on the top of his head. When we came up we shot
the bull. But my uncle was a dead man!’</p>

<p>After a little further conversation on the peculiarities
of game and their habits, the party broke up, and all
retired to bed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII<br />

<span class="medium">SCHRIKRIGHIED</span></h3>

<p>An early start was made the next day to proceed on their
trip, as the plan was not to stay at any one place more
than two days so as to enable them to see as many
places and people as possible.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon they arrived at the camping
place of a party of transport riders, who were spending
a month in the bush veld to recruit their worn-out
draught oxen. They were a rough-and-ready lot, but a
merry and entertaining party withal.</p>

<p>They were very hospitable and kind, taking the young
holiday-makers to the best coverts for birds and game.
But what amused Steve most of all was that one of the
party was one who <i>schriked</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>Before proceeding, I must explain what is meant
by this word.</p>

<p>The dictionary translates <i>schrik</i> to mean fright, dread,
terror, horror. But this hardly explains what is meant
by the term here. Here it is meant to represent a
combination of ticklishness and <i>schrikishness</i>, if I may
be allowed to use the words in such a manner.</p>

<p>In South Africa, one often meets with persons who are
thus affected in various stages. Some need to be
touched under the arms, when they will shout out as
loud as you like, and jump as high as you please.
Some will be affected in the same way by being shown
certain animals or insects, composing their particular
dread, such as a spider, a frog or mouse. To others
you need but to suddenly mention their particular
objects of dread to make them act as if they were
mad.</p>

<p>To others, again, the worst of all&mdash;after having once
startled them and put them on the <i>qui vive</i>, you may
stand at any safe distance, and in a sudden, sharp,
commanding tone, order them to do or say what you
please, and they simply cannot resist doing as you
say.</p>

<p>This disease, as one may call it, is generally acquired by
being over tickled in your youth, or receiving a bad fright,
as the reader may gather from the recitals of the victims
themselves further on. To some people it is a serious
burden to be thus affected, as the amusement caused
by their doing all sorts of ludicrous things at the will
of everyone, tempts everybody to make them <i>schrik</i>,
and the continual shock to the system causes them
to tremble all over, and to feel an excess of nervousness
not at all conducive to good health. The
writer has known a strong healthy young man thus
affected, to faint on being tickled under the arms while
being held down.</p>

<p>Steve delighted in these comical persons, who <i>would</i>
be so stupid as to do what you tell them, or say out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
loud what you whispered to them, simply out of <i>schrik</i>.
But he always took care not to make an abuse of the
amusement; for as soon as he saw his victim getting
too excited, he would soothe him and spare him further
for the time being.</p>

<p>The victim in this particular instance was named <i>Piet</i>.
They were sitting having their dinner. Each was holding
his mug of coffee in one hand; the kettle was
empty; no more coffee to be had unless the kettle was
first boiled. One of the transport riders looks round
and winks, and says suddenly,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Piet, throw that mug away.’ Away goes the mug,
coffee and all.</p>

<p>Steve sees how the land lies, and joins in the laugh,
seeing some fun ahead.</p>

<p>After Piet’s cup had been replenished by getting a
portion from each of the other cups, he thought, ‘Now
I shall be able to finish my meal,’ when he received the
command, ‘Jump up, Piet.’ He jumped up as ordered,
dropping both cup and food this time. He stood
looking comically and disgustedly at his nice venison
steak lying in the ashes, while the others were splitting
their sides with laughing. Steve, of course, laughed as
much as anyone else, and more so&mdash;it <i>was</i> so foolish to
throw your food away like that.</p>

<p>After once more sharing food and drink with the
others, he was allowed to finish his meal. After dinner,
some Kaffir women came to the camp to sell <i>stamp
mealies</i> (shelled maize). Some were bought and Piet
was requested to pay. He took out his purse, opened it,
and took out a shilling to pay the girl, when</p>

<p>‘Give her the purse,’ came the order.</p>

<p>‘<i>De, de</i>’ (here, here), cried poor Piet, forcing the
purse full of silver into the hands of the astonished black
lady.</p>

<p>He was allowed to take back his purse, put it in his
pocket, when once more came the order,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Shake hands with her.’ He seized the black girl’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
hand and shook it heartily, only to drop it in disgust,
and call for soap, muttering something about,
‘This is too much, shaking hands with the dirty, greasy
thing; soap will hardly wash the stinking grease off
my hand again.’ The others were lying on their backs
shaking with laughter, and holding their sides. The
black woman had never been so astonished. Never
had a white man offered to shake hands with her
before.</p>

<p>‘Take off your hat to the lady,’ once more heard Piet.
He took off his hat and made a profound bow to the
staring sable woman. The next moment he took off
his hat again and tramped upon it, as if the hat was to
be blamed for being lifted in greeting to a nigger.</p>

<p>He was allowed to take a breath now, as the others
felt it would be fatal for them to laugh any more.
Steve felt as if his cheeks would never take their
normal position again; they had been stretched out of
position so much from laughing.</p>

<p>Presently the oxen came in to be kraaled for the
night. <i>Speelman</i>&mdash;an old Hottentot&mdash;the herder, came
up to the fire to be rationed.</p>

<p>Steve and his party had not seen Speelman before,
as he had been in the veld all day herding the cattle.
He was a short, pot-bellied old sinner, with a round
bullet head, and a face, all wrinkles, which seemed as if
made of elastic when he drew it into his broad,
hypocritical smile, as he came towards Baas Piet and
asked for some <i>baccy</i>.</p>

<p>Piet took out his <i>span</i> of tobacco, cut off a few
inches, and handed it to Speelman, when one of his
friends named Daniel shouted <i>slang</i> (snake).</p>

<p>Speelman bounded into the air, and made Piet <i>schrik</i>
too as he came down again, and catching hold of Piet
round the body, hung there, kicking and howling. ‘Help,
baas, help, <i>slang, slang</i>.’ And as he hung and kicked,
Piet struggled and shouted, the one seemed as excited
and frightened as the other.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>The scene was too much for mortal man to stand.
Steve fell on the ground, and rolled about on the grass
as he laughed. He had to close his eyes. He felt, if he
looked longer on the ludicrous scene, he would break
something; his sides had already been abnormally
strained. When he opened his eyes, Piet and Speelman
were arguing the matter out.</p>

<p>‘If you hang to me again with those dirty paws of
yours I shall kick you.’ Piet was saying in disgust.</p>

<p>‘But, baas, how can I help it, when Baas Daniel
frightened me so? Please give me some other tobacco,
baas; mine fell, and I can’t find it,’ he said supplicatingly.</p>

<p>‘Ask Baas Daniel; he made you lose yours, and now
he can give you some other.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, please, Baas Daniel, give poor old Speelman some
other tobacco, I have had nothing to smoke all the
afternoon.’ said the old hypocrite, as he went and
stood in front of Daniel. Piet saw his opportunity was
come for revenge. He shouted,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Speelman, kiss Baas Daniel.’</p>

<p>Speelman rushed forward and caught hold of Daniel,
and tried his level best to approach his already smacking
lips to the lips of Daniel. The woods rang with the
roars of laughter as the young fellows saw the biter bitten
in this unexpected manner. Daniel caught hold of
Speelman by the throat, and even then he had great
difficulty to keep the dirty smacking lips of the Hottentot
away from his, for Speelman had again, for the second
time, heard Piet’s command to ‘kiss Baas Daniel.’
At last Daniel succeeded by main force to throw the
Hottentot away from him.</p>

<p>At first Daniel was inclined to resent the trick played
on him by Piet, but he was told that he had done as
much to Piet, or nearly so, in causing Piet to shake
hands with the Kaffir woman; and he had to acknowledge
the truth of it and join in the laugh against himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>When Steve recovered from his last fit of laughter, he
called Speelman to him, emptied his pouch in his hand,
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Now, Speelman, tell me what makes you so disrespectful
to your baas as to try and kiss him?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t help it, baas, I am so <i>schriking</i>. When I am
told to do anything, I do it.’</p>

<p>‘But what makes you do so?’</p>

<p>‘Baas, when I was a boy I one day fell asleep under
a tree. When I awoke, a snake was partly coiled round
my neck, and part of it was coiled on my breast; and
when I saw and felt it, I <i>schriked</i> so I thought I should
die. I jumped up and tore the snake from me, and ran
away as fast as I could, until I was so tired I could
run no more. After that, baas, if you only say <i>snake</i> to
me, you can make me do whatever you like.’</p>

<p>‘Snake,’ called out Steve’s cousin at this moment.</p>

<p>‘Where? Where? Where?’ shouted Speelman, dancing
and jumping about.</p>

<p>‘Stand on your head,’ shouted Keith. He hardly
expected his order to be executed, and was surprised to
see Speelman fall down and stand on his head, kicking
his heels in the air, while he shouted, <i>Slang, slang</i>
(snake, snake).</p>

<p>Steve now interposed, and said that they had had
enough fun out of Speelman for once. They ought to
let him rest now and take breath.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was spent in yarning and storytelling
generally, after which all went to bed.</p>

<span class="medium">STUCK IN THE MUD</span></h3>

<p>The following day, Steve and his three companions had
good sport amongst the guinea-fowl and other birds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>The transport riders had left early in the morning,
each with a good load of firewood for the Pretoria
market, as their month of inactivity was at an end, and
they had once more to begin work. It had been agreed
that the party with the cart should start about ten o’clock
from the night’s camping place, after having had a turn
at the guinea-fowl, etc., and as the waggons started at
seven, the cart would catch up with them somewhere
about noon, when they could once more have dinner
together.</p>

<p>As agreed so done. Steve and his companions came
speeding towards the drift, beyond which, it had been
agreed, the waggons would outspan, and get dinner ready.
As they came nearer, they heard an uproar of oxwhips
clapping, and men shouting. When they arrived on the
scene they saw that one of the waggons was <i>stuck</i> in the
drift.</p>

<p>All the other waggons had crossed safely, but the last
one, the most heavily laden, and having the weakest span
of oxen, had sunk deep in the mud of the drift. The
water was no more than two feet deep, but the mud was
nearly as deep in itself.</p>

<p>The occupants of the cart saw at a glance that there
was no chance for them to pass while the waggon occupied
the narrow drift. They, therefore, left Harrison
in charge of the cart, and went forward to see how
matters proceeded. They found the waggon sunk to the
nave in the mud. The oxen were panting and struggling
to pull through the mud. Their leader was pulled hither
and thither as they swayed to and fro in their efforts to
pull out. The men, half naked, were struggling about
in the water, talking to the oxen, and clapping their
whips. But in vain, the waggon would not budge an
inch.</p>

<p>The youngsters from town thought this struggling
about in the water trying to extricate a waggon stuck in
the mud fine fun, so they took off their clothes, and
joined the party of transport riders in the water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>Steve and his friends soon discovered that the pleasantest
part of the fun was to sit, perched on top of the
waggon, and watch the efforts of the others to urge the
oxen forward.</p>

<p>There was a lull. Another span of oxen had been
sent for to hook on in front. Speelman, who had been
the liveliest in his efforts to get forward, was standing
alongside of the hind oxen. He was almost naked,
having just a remnant of a shirt on. He looked like a
dusky mermaid of the waters, he moved so rapidly about;
he was now under the oxen, now right under the trek
chain; he seemed to be everywhere.</p>

<p>‘I say, Speelman, did you see any snakes this morning?’
asked Steve.</p>

<p>‘No, baas, don’t want to see ’em,’ said Speelman,
suspiciously looking about him, as if he expected to see
snakes in the water.</p>

<p>‘Jump on the ox,’ cried Keith; and in a second
Speelman was astride of the kicking bullock.</p>

<p>‘Stand on your head in the water,’ cried Keith again,
not expecting to be obeyed in this. But Speelman
ducked into the water, head foremost, and only the tips
of his legs were seen above water, kicking furiously.</p>

<p>‘You shouldn’t do that,’ said Steve, laughing. ‘It is
dangerous; he might get drowned.’</p>

<p>He remained down so long, and the kicking became
so furious, that Steve became anxious. He shouted to
him to get up, but Speelman could not hear him.</p>

<p>‘By Jove! his head must be sticking in the mud,’ he
cried, and jumping down, he seized Speelman by the
legs and pulled him up. Assisted by Keith from the
waggon, the poor old Hottentot was dragged on to the
seat of the waggon. The poor old fellow presented a
most comical face when pulled up. He was drawing in
great breaths, to get his steam up again, while he spat
the black mud out of his mouth. His whole head, eyes,
ears and all were thickly coated with the black, sticky
mud, while his pepper corn hair had disappeared under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
a coating of the same black, smooth pomade. It appears
that his head really <i>did</i> stick in the mud.</p>

<p>‘You must not do that again, baas; poor old Speelman
would have been drowned if the baas had not pulled him
out,’ said he to Keith.</p>

<p>As to Keith, he and his companions had been too
frightened to laugh at this exhibition of Speelman’s
funniosities. He gave Speelman half-a-crown, and told
him to go and wash the mud out of his mouth at the
canteen beyond the drift. At this moment the extra
span of oxen arrived, was attached to the front of the
regular span, and with a <i>Trek, trek, haai you schelm, vat
zou blik schottel</i>, the waggon moved forward, and was
soon outspanned with the rest on the other side of the
drift. The cart followed over, and soon the whole party
was partaking of the regular bush veld fare&mdash;venison
steak, leg of venison, broiled guinea-fowl, and <i>storm
jagers</i> (dough cakes).</p>

<p>Speelman followed the advice given him by Baas
Keith, and after having imbibed a pint of peach brandy,
was as merry as a cricket, and was none the worse for his
immersion, except, perhaps, that he was a little more
pot-bellied than usual from the quantity of water he had
drunk while standing on his head in the drift.</p>

<p>After dinner, Steve and his party took leave of the
transport riders with mutual expressions of good will and
hopes of meeting again.</p>

<p>In this way they proceeded from camp to camp.
Many parties of farmers were met wintering with their
herds in the bush veld; and all they had to do was to
decide at which encampment they would outspan, or at
which they would spend the night, which was mostly
decided by the party of farmers who could give the
most favourable report as to the game in their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>They had various success. One day, perhaps, they had
the best of sport, the next day, perhaps, they failed in
bringing down a single head of game. But on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
whole, they were perfectly satisfied with their trip. We
shall relate only one more incident of their holiday trip.
It was the last day; that evening they hoped to sleep in
Pretoria again. They were speeding along merrily. It
was still forenoon, and Pretoria was hardly four hours
distant, so they had no doubt of reaching home before
night. It had rained severely the day before along the
track of country on which they were then travelling.
Suddenly they turned into the main road from the warm
baths, and now they had reason to regret the rain of the
day before&mdash;they were in the famous <i>turf veld</i>.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far before the turf began to
tell severely on the pace of the horses. At first they
slackened their speed only a little, but soon they were
going at barely more than a walk. The sticky black
soil was coating the wheels to such a degree that the
spokes gradually became nearer and nearer to each
other, until the wheels had no spokes, but became a solid
mass of black turf. All that the travellers could do was
to halt and scrape off the worst part of the mud, when
for a time they were able to go on again at a slightly
better pace. Full advantage was taken of any unbroken
veld, where the heavy waggons had not yet cut up the soil
into furrows and ridges of soft black soil. But these
patches were scarce, as every driver of waggon or cart
generally turns out of the beaten track into the grass
alongside, and in course of time the quarter or half mile
strip of country, which is supposed to be left unfenced
along all roads as feeding ground for trekking herds,
becomes so cut up that very little choice is left the
traveller as to where he shall steer his weary beasts.</p>

<p>The young men were wearily and dejectedly plodding
along, dismounting now and again to scrape the wheels,
when they came to a waggon standing in the middle of
the road&mdash;deserted. The oxen were still inspanned and
seemed waiting for their owner. No fear of their running
away; how could they? Their own feet were
invisible, a round mass of black <i>turf</i>&mdash;twice the usual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
size of ox feet&mdash;was all that was visible where their feet
ought to be, while the wheels of the waggon seemed to be
made of solid chunks of mud&mdash;no spokes, no rims, no
naves being visible.</p>

<p>‘Well, this is funny,’ remarked Harrison; ‘a waggon
without owner. There is something wrong here; nobody
would leave their waggon inspanned like this&mdash;untended.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is queer,’ answered Steve. ‘But I fancy there
is the owner coming on,’ said he, pointing to a man
visible in the road about half a mile farther on.</p>

<p>‘It may be the owner, but he is not coming, but
standing, evidently waiting for the party I see farther
on.’</p>

<p>‘Why, the nearest one is a woman,’ said Keith, ‘the
other one is a man; but I wonder what is the matter with
them? They both remain standing on one spot, but
they are gesticulating like mad.’</p>

<p>They soon approached the first party they had seen.
<span class="smcap">It</span> <i>was</i> a woman. She was an elderly old lady, very
stout in the beams, and one would have thought, even
under ordinary circumstances, she must find it difficult to
walk any distance. She appeared to be standing on two
lumps of turf, but&mdash;they were sticking to her feet. Every
step she took increased the size of the lump, until at last
she was obliged to stop, she could drag her burden
(which, unlike that of Christian, was attached to her feet)
along no more.</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m blessed if it is not old Mrs M’Kwaire,’
cried Steve.</p>

<p>‘And who may she be?’ queried Keith.</p>

<p>‘Why, she is Mrs M’Kwaire,’ he replied, laughing.
‘She is an old lady of Dutch extraction, married to an
old Irishman, both characters in their way&mdash;very comical
and amusing as a rule; it is most amusing to set old
M’Kwaire’s tongue a-wagging by mentioning <i>Home Rule</i>.
If you once start him, you may go away for half-an-hour
and come back to find him still talking to some imaginary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
antagonist about Home Rule and the wrongs
of Ireland.’</p>

<p>‘Hillo, Tante, why don’t you ride on the waggon?’
cried out Steve, as they stopped alongside of her.</p>

<p>‘That is what I would like to do,’ she replied, ‘but
that foolish Pat would get down to pick up a yoke
skey lying in the road, when he remained <i>stuck</i>, and,
as the oxen would not stop, I, like another fool, got
down to help him while the oxen walked on with the
waggon to where it is now standing. And now I am
sticking between Pat and the waggon; I can’t get to him,
he cannot get to me, and neither of us can get to the
waggon.’</p>

<p>The young fellows could not help bursting into loud
roars of laughter at the ludicrousness of the scene.
They halted as near to the old lady as possible, and
helped her on to their cart and drove on to where
Pat was standing, talking and swearing all the time.</p>

<p>‘Well, old <i>Stick-in-the-mud</i>,’ cried Keith, ‘it seems
the mountain <i>won’t</i> come to Mahomet, and Mahomet
<i>can’t</i> go to the mountain; what does Mahomet intend
doing now?’ All laughed at this sally.</p>

<p>‘Begorrah, sor, ye niver would lave a pore old mon
’ere.’</p>

<p>‘No, I am afraid that would be another wrong to
old Oireland. Well, Pat, if Ireland can get out of
her troubles as easily as you, I would advise you to
get back to her, and stand for the first election of
president, king, or emperor, whatever your new constitution
would call your chief ruler. I think you
stand a good chance.’</p>

<p>‘Come along, Keith, that is enough for one day, you
are getting too humorously clever,’ said Steve. ‘Give
us your hand, Pat, and jump up if you can.’</p>

<p>But Pat could not jump. He had to be dragged into
the cart, and was thus able to sit down and scrape his
feet clean again.</p>

<p>Pat and Mrs Pat were driven back to their waggon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
and left behind to proceed to their farm, while the
party in the cart proceeded on their way to Pretoria,
where they arrived just as darkness was closing in.</p>

<p>‘There is one thing I would like to remark now that
we are home again,’ remarked Keith. ‘And it is just
this. I have been converted. I had always been
impressed with the idea that the Boers are half savage,
exclusive, inhospitable and unkind to strangers, especially
to Englishmen. I have seen my error. I do not
believe there is a country in the world where one
would receive such kindness, consideration and hospitality
as we have received during our trip. I for one
reckon myself as the friend and champion of all Boers
from to-day.’</p>

<p>‘You are right,’ said Harrison. ‘When we started, I
hardly believed Steve’s promise of hospitality from all
and sundry, and fully expected to have rough times of
it, and I have been agreeably disappointed at the
kindness shown us by all.’

<h3 id="CHAP_I">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="medium">POLITICAL SUICIDE&mdash;HERESY</span></h3>

<p>The day after their return, Steve heard faint rumours of
a certain conference which had been held in Pretoria the
last few days in reference to territories lying beyond the
northern borders of the South African Republic. He
had been too busy attending to accumulated work to
take much notice, or to inquire about it. But now it
was evening and after dinner, and he was comfortably
seated in an arm-chair in the sitting-room of his boarding-house.
He was listening to the usual after-dinner debate
on current topics.</p>

<p>‘What is that you are saying about the Transvaal
signing its own death warrant, Thomson?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘I say that the Transvaal signs its own death warrant
in agreeing to waive any rights they may have northward
or westward of their present boundary. It means
that they are now definitely enclosed by British territory
with the exception of the strip of border which
adjoins Portuguese territory.’</p>

<p>‘And what consideration is promised the Transvaal as
compensation for committing political and national suicide
in this way?’ inquired Steve.</p>

<p>‘Oh, they have some verbal promise to the effect that
they will be allowed to annex Swaziland <i>later</i> on, and
some faint hope is held out to them to be allowed some
day to secure a seaport in Amatongaland.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>‘But if they have Swaziland and Amatongaland beyond,
right up to the sea, thus securing a seaport, how
can they be enclosed? That means that they would be
less enclosed than they are now by British territory,’</p>

<p>‘Ha, ha!’ laughed Thomson. ‘Do you think they will
ever get it? No, my dear fellow, I am sorry to disappoint
you, but a verbal promise does not count in
diplomacy. Swaziland they may get&mdash;perhaps&mdash;but a
seaport&mdash;never. It was only a bait held out to the
stupid Boers. The bait will be drawn in gradually, until
the Boers are enticed into the trap laid for them, when
even the bait will be taken from them, and they will be
starved out in the trap, until, like a starved and trapped
lion, they will have to submit. The joke of the whole
thing is that Hofmeyr, the head of the Colonial Afrikander
Bond, has been used by Rhodes to accomplish his
object.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you are right. But it is not a joke, it is disgraceful,
shameful, to be bitten thus by your own dogs.
I wonder that a man like Hofmeyr&mdash;who is supposed to
be a patriotic Afrikander&mdash;cannot see what he is assisting
to do. Can’t he see that he is assisting Rhodes to
kill all the national vitality of the Afrikander race in
South Africa? Does he not know that round the independence
of the Transvaal revolves the whole hope of
Afrikander national existence? Is he blind, or is he a
traitor? I used to be proud of the Afrikander Bond,
but now I am beginning to be ashamed of them, when
they support a man like Rhodes. A man who works,
firstly, for self-aggrandizement, and secondly, of course,
for Imperialism.’</p>

<p>All the Englishmen present laughed at Steve’s earnestness
and bitterness against Hofmeyr for working thus
against the Transvaal. But they were accustomed to
his earnest patriotism, and respected him for it.</p>

<p>‘Well, old boy, it may be that Hofmeyr has been
squared by Rhodes; who knows? Rhodes is known for
his squaring propensities. Or it may be that Hofmeyr
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
is wiser than you, and has seen that it is foolish to kick
against the pricks, and that it is better to belong to the
glorious British Empire, with its traditions of military
power and glory, its traditions of wealth in gold and
literature.’</p>

<p>‘It may be so,’ replied Steve; ‘but as a leading
Afrikander, I would rather hope and believe that he is
only blind, and that some day his eyes will be opened,
and that he shall see Rhodes as he is. As to cornering
the Transvaal, let them go on. Only I would warn our
enemies that though we are a quiet and peace-loving
people, preferring to till the land and herd our cattle to
fighting, yet I say I warn Rhodes and his clique that an
Afrikander at bay is fiercer and more dangerous than any
tiger or lion at bay, so let them look out.’</p>

<p>‘But, Steve, why are you such an intense Republican?
why will you not be satisfied to live under the English
flag? Then you would have the right to call upon the
whole British Empire to protect you. Then you would
be a member of the greatest nation on earth. Then you
can say, “I am a subject to a queen upon whose
dominions the sun never sets.” Is not that better than
to have a second-rate republic, with no traditions older
than say twenty years; with hardly any literature at all;
what more would you have than I have said you would
have as a British subject?’</p>

<p>‘We would be FREE!’ was Steve’s curt reply.</p>

<p>‘Free! what is the good of being free in a country
like this? As I have said, you can only hope to have
a second-rate republic, the population of which at best
is but a mongrel race.’</p>

<p>‘A mongrel race!’ echoed Steve. ‘We <i>are</i> a mixed
race, if you like, but a mixture of the best blood of
Europe. In our veins run the best blood of France,
Holland and Germany. We are descended from heroes;
our forefathers have been heroes ever since they left
their ancestral homes in Europe for religion and principle:
and we are heroes to-day, struggling, as we are, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
national existence and freedom, and that against the
mightiest empire on earth, as you describe it; but justice
and right must prevail in the end. A mongrel race, you
say? A race, I say, that has the grandest future before
them of any race upon earth. Look at them; toiling
sons of Nature! Do they not remind you of the rough
diamonds dug out in Kimberley? hardy, strong, persevering,
unpretending, but God-fearing as they are.
Look at the few of them that have received the least
bit of polish. Do they not shine enough to blind your
eyes as you look upon them? Wait till they have all
been polished and rubbed into shape, and then you will
see what a race of men God has raised in this wilderness?’
Steve’s eyes were shining with enthusiasm. He seemed
to see in imagination the future he was describing.</p>

<p>‘You have made out a very good case for your people
as a nation, Steve, but what will you do with all the
Englishmen in South Africa if it should become an
Afrikander republic, as you seem to wish and hope?
Will you drive them out of the country, or will you let
them live an Uitlander race for ever here, as this Government
is doing now? Will you exclude them from your
future great South African nation?’</p>

<p>‘Decidedly not. We should be only too pleased to
have them unite with us. I don’t know why they should
remain Imperialistic for ever. In America they did not
remain so! <i>There</i> they have united with other nationalities;
why should they not do so here? Anyone who
desires to become an Afrikander, be he English, Dutch,
German, French, or even Russian by birth, all we should
wish of them will be to have one object with us in
promoting the happiness and peace of Republican South
Africa.’</p>

<p>‘In short, they may be of whatever European nationality
they like, but they must be for <i>Republicanism</i>?’</p>

<p>‘Even so!’</p>

<p>‘Now, Steve, you have defeated me at all points, I am
almost bound to confess. It is a glorious object towards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
which you are tending, viz., a great and free <i>united
South Africa</i>. But why does not your Government,
whom you defend so much, make some beginning
towards a union of the races by granting the franchise
to all Uitlanders in this State?’</p>

<p>‘Because the time has not come yet. To grant the franchise
now to everyone would be simply killing our future
great nation in its infancy. Grant the franchise now to
all strangers (of which the great majority are English),
and in a year’s time this country will be governed, either
as an English republic, with capitalistic rulers, or as an
English colony, neither of which are desirable, you
will grant&mdash;from our standpoint. While, if we had
South Africa united as a republic, there would be no
obstacle in the way of granting the franchise to everybody,
as the main object would be attained then, and
we would be strong enough to hold our own against any
party of either foreigners, Imperialists or capitalists who
may seek to overthrow us again.’</p>

<p>‘Even there I must say you are right; I am almost inclined
to become an Afrikander already. Now I am
afraid you will not be able to answer my next question
as well. You may think it immaterial, but I think it of
great importance, that a people and a country should
possess a literature of its own. What have you to say
to that?’</p>

<p>‘Of course we cannot pretend to possess a varied and
extended literature like England has. There can be no
question of rivalry as yet. But we are not altogether
without a literature of our own. We have our own
patriotic songs, and even poems. We have a few authors,
too, of whom we need not be ashamed, chief amongst
these we count Mrs Cornwright Schreiner, whose
thoughtful book is read all the world over. Then we
have the literature of our mother countries&mdash;Holland,
France and Germany. We love to read the stories
which tell of the vicissitudes of our forefathers in their
own countries. We even take a sort of sad delight in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
reading of the persecutions our ancestors had to undergo
for their religious opinions; persecutions which led either
to the scaffold, or to banishment. Then, as I have said,
we have the literature of Holland and other countries
which has been translated into our language. We read
all historical, religious, secular poetry or prose; all is grist
to our mill, we only seek knowledge, and as we are
thoroughly cosmopolitan, we care not from whose experience
or knowledge, we can learn.</p>

<p>‘Then we have hope of future advancement in this line.
Rome was not built in a day, and you cannot expect us
to be the only exception to the rule, that it takes time to
perfect all things. As education advances, and we begin
to feel more and more that we are a people of some
account, our national abilities will develop, and we may
expect to gradually advance towards perfection in all
things, such as national administration, education, literature,
etc. Give us time!’</p>

<p>‘Well, I am glad to see that you are honest enough to
acknowledge your defects, as well as to extol your virtues
and natural abilities. I certainly grant the material for
developement is there. It was only a week ago I saw a
manuscript poem, which was written by a brick-maker, a
poor Boer, who, unkempt, ill-clothed and unshaved,
appeared to me as if he were incapable of stringing two
thoughts together, and yet, as far as I could understand
the short poem, which was written in the <i>Taal</i>, was
admirable and forcible enough, though crude and rough
in expression. I fancy if such a fellow had received a
fair education he would have done something.’</p>

<p>‘Talking about natural abilities,’ remarked Theron, ‘I
saw a couple of gravestones, made by one Joubert of this
district, at his farm, the other day. It was made from a
design in a book of patterns supplied to him by a friend.
It was simply splendid! The angels, vines and flowers,
as shown in the pattern, were brought out in grand relief
and were most accurately delineated. I do not think the
most skilled artisan could improve on it. Then there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
were a few others made from designs of his own, composed
of flowers, ferns and other natural objects, all in
the best of taste and design, and in perfect proportion.
This man had never been taught sculpture, engraving or
any of the kindred arts; it was simply his own natural
taste and ability cropping out.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ remarked another one, ‘I have often wondered
at the skill of some Boers, as shown in the manufacture
of various articles of furniture and nick-nacks generally.
They seem to do it all without being taught or
shown.’</p>

<p>‘What surprises me more than all,’ remarked Harrison,
‘is the oratorical powers displayed by some of these uneducated
Boers. I attended a sitting of the Volksraad
the other day, and the speeches were simply grand. The
earnestness and pointed argument, as well as the connected
phrasing, was most surprising from men who had
received no more education than how to read their Bible
and to crudely write an ordinary letter. Then I attended
a funeral a short time ago, at which a leading member
of the Volksraad gave a funeral oration as well as a really
good sermon; and, listening to him, I could hardly believe
that I was not listening to a learned and perfectly
educated minister of the Gospel.’</p>

<p>‘You have only to read some of the letters on public
questions, such as often appear in the Dutch papers, written
by them, to get some idea of the natural abilities of the
unlearned Boer,’ remarked Steve, rising and leaving the
room, as he was tired and wanted to go to bed.</p>

<span class="medium">A GREENHORN</span></h3>

<p>Twelve months passed after this&mdash;uneventfully, so far as
Steve’s private life was concerned. But at this time he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
had an attack of malarial fever, which left him weak and
pale. He decided to take a week’s holiday, and spend
it at the farm of an old farmer who had often asked him
to pay him a visit.</p>

<p>After a couple of days’ stay at this farm, he found his
health and strength coming back to him. On the third
day of his stay, he went for a walk, accompanied by Fritz,
the son of his host, and a Hollander who had only just
arrived the day before to take up the position of tutor in
the family of the old farmer.</p>

<p>Fritz was a merry, mischievous young fellow of eighteen;
and as he was considered old enough to assist his father
in looking after the farm, he was not a pupil of the new
teacher, and therefore considered himself at liberty to
make as much fun of the <i>green</i> Hollander as opportunity
offered. During the walk above mentioned, Fritz had
taken the opportunity to begin <i>Mijnheer van der Tromp’s
education</i>, as he termed it.</p>

<p>‘How is he going to educate the children while <i>his</i>
education is being neglected?’ was his question, in
answer to his father’s remonstrances.</p>

<p>He began the Hollander’s education by marching him
through the orchard, in Steve’s company, and giving him
the names of the different kinds of fruit and vegetables&mdash;all
wrong, of course.</p>

<p>‘Do you see this tree, mijnheer? It is the sweet
potato tree,’&mdash;it was a peach.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you don’t say so! Do sweet potatoes grow on
such a tall tree? I should like to taste some of them
when they are ripe.’</p>

<p>‘And this is a pine apple tree,’ remarked Fritz, pointing
out a fine banana bush.</p>

<p>‘How wonderful Nature is,’ soliloquised the poor city
bred Hollander. ‘Everything in Nature has its peculiar
wonders, and is made by God with its own peculiar
habits.’</p>

<p>‘And this tree, teacher, which you see is full of
beautiful yellow ripe fruit, is our South African fig?’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
continued Fritz, now drawing the attention of the teacher
to a fine specimen of the prickly pear. (Turkish <i>fig</i> is
the Dutch name for it literally translated.)</p>

<p>‘What, are these figs? and are they fit for eating now?’
asked Mijnheer van der Tromp.</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, teacher, and I can assure you they are
delicious eating too,’ replied Fritz, turning away and
walking on. Of course Fritz knew what was going to
happen. Steve had walked on a few paces, as he was
afraid he would be unable to contain his laughter if he
listened any longer to Fritz’s fooling; so the poor Hollander
was perfectly at the mercy of Fritz, as Steve did
not overhear the information just given about the prickly
pear.</p>

<p>The first intimation Steve had of what was going on
was when he heard suppressed laughter behind him. He
looked round, and at what he saw he thought that both
his companions must have taken leave of their senses.
Fritz was red in the face from laughing, as he lay on the
grass, throwing his hands and feet about in the air like
the four arms of a windmill. He seemed to be absolutely
mad.</p>

<p>As to the poor Hollander, his actions were almost
indescribable. He was standing, holding his arms out
full length, fingers extended, while his head was held
out forward, with his capacious mouth open to its full
extent, and an expression of agony was depicted upon
his countenance, while he was uttering such inarticulate
sounds as a man could utter while holding his mouth
open without moving tongue or lips. What had happened
was this. The Hollander, as soon as Fritz’s
back was turned, had seized one of the most tempting
looking prickly pears, and had taken a hasty bite out of
it. The result was that the inside of his mouth was
covered with hundreds of the minute needle-pointed
thorns. Only those who have felt the irritating pain of
a prickly pear thorn in the mouth can understand the
torture poor Van der Tromp had to endure. Steve led
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
him home, where he was seated on a low stool for hours
following, while the members of the family took turns
to hunt the thorns out of his mouth.</p>

<p>But prickly pear thorns are not picked out of a man’s
mouth in one day, especially after they have been planted
there in such a wholesale manner, as was the case with
Van der Tromp. For days after those thorns <i>would</i>
intrude themselves upon the attention of the teacher.
Every time he would make sure that not a single thorn
was left in his mouth. But suddenly, every half hour or
so, while Van der Tromp was eating, singing, or speaking,
an expression of agony would pass over his countenance
as another of those little demon thorns would
make itself felt. And then every other occupation would
be suspended while that little thorn was being hunted
for.</p>

<p>Of course, Fritz did not think, or expect, his little joke
to turn out such a serious matter for the poor teacher.
The most he hoped for was that the teacher would pluck
the prickly pear, and thus feel the thorns. He never
thought that Van der Tromp would <i>bite</i> the fruit. When
he saw the agony of Van der Tromp, he was genuinely
sorry, and apologised most humbly, but I am afraid he
was never forgiven.</p>

<h3 id="CHAP_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="medium">GOLD BEYOND THE DREAM OF AVARICE&mdash;DESPISED</span></h3>

<p>The following day Steve and Fritz went for another walk,
farther this time, but alone. Van der Tromp was still
occupied in digging out prickly pear thorns.</p>

<p>During the night a heavy thunder storm had raged;
the air was pure and fresh, so that the young men walked
far out into the veld, as they enjoyed the bright face
Nature had put on after the storm.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>When they had walked some distance, they met a
herder herding some sheep belonging to Fritz’s
father. He came up to them, and showed Fritz a bar of
metal two feet long and about one inch in diameter,
more or less, as it was of irregular thickness.</p>

<p>‘See, baas, what a nice piece of brass I found. The
rain of last night had washed it clean, so that I saw
it shining amongst the rocks.’</p>

<p>Steve took it from him and examined it closely, and
felt the weight of it.</p>

<p>‘Where did you get this, boy?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘I found it sticking to two rocks, baas. Each end
of it was fast on to a rock, so that it was a sort of
little bridge between the two pieces of rock.’</p>

<p>‘Come and show me and Baas Fritz the place.’</p>

<p>The boy went on ahead to show the place as requested.</p>

<p>‘Do you think it is gold, Steve?’ asked Fritz.</p>

<p>‘I am sure of its being gold. There must be lots of
it, too, if it can be picked up in this way,’ was the answer.</p>

<p>The boy stopped and pointed to some rocks which
were lying in the cleft of a low hill. The cleft was
a little rivulet when it rained, as the sides of the
hill sloped down to it, thus causing all the water to
run towards it, and so form a temporary stream.</p>

<p>The boy pointed to two masses of quartz forming
the two banks of the cleft or ravine. He showed them
the marks where he had broken off the bar of gold.</p>

<p>The young men examined the masses of rock or quartz
closely. Steve took a large stone and knocked two small
pieces off the quartz, and looked at the freshly-broken
surface. It was interlaced with gold! They examined
an outcrop of quartz further on, and found it to be as
rich as the other. Fully twenty-five per cent. of the
quartz seemed to be gold.</p>

<p>Fritz had whispered to Steve not to let the boy know
what it was. He had to put forth great self-control to
restrain his excitement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>They turned quietly back and walked home.</p>

<p>‘I say, Fritz, this means that you are going to be one
of the richest men in the country. There is not another
such mine of gold in the world as this one is going to be.’</p>

<p>‘Wait and hear what the old man says about it first,’
said Fritz.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’ asked Steve.</p>

<p>‘Wait,’ was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>They arrived home and found the old man superintending
the planting of some <i>shade</i> trees near the house.
They went up to him, and showed him the bar of gold
discovered by the boy.</p>

<p>‘See, father, what April found,’ said Fritz.</p>

<p>‘What is it?’</p>

<p>‘Gold,’ said Steve.</p>

<p>The old man stood looking at them for fully a minute,
then asked for an explanation. He was told all that had
taken place.</p>

<p>He did not say a word, but Steve could see that he
was by no means pleased. In the evening, when the
herds were all safely in the kraal, Steve, Fritz and the
old farmer were sitting on the stoep smoking. In front
of the stoep half-a-dozen cows and heifers were standing.
The old man had ordered them to be driven out of the
herd, and to await his further orders.</p>

<p>April the herder, and discoverer of gold, was sent for.
He came.</p>

<p>‘April,’ said the farmer, ‘I believe your time is up at
the end of the week?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, baas.’</p>

<p>‘Do you intend going home then?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, baas!’</p>

<p>‘I owe you three heifers for your time of service, do
I not?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, baas!’</p>

<p>‘Well, there are six. Three in payment for your
service, and three if you will leave to-morrow morning
early without saying a word to anyone, and I want you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
never to come on my farm again. You must also
promise me never to tell anybody about the copper you
found on the stone to-day. Do you promise?’</p>

<p>The Kaffir was amazed. To receive double his salary,
and to go before his time was up, with an order never to
return again, was incomprehensible to him. However,
he gave the promise required, and left.</p>

<p>Steve could hardly make out the drift of the old man.
He simply stared in surprise at his host.</p>

<p>‘Now, Stephaans, I want you also to promise me never
to tell anyone of the gold on my farm, unless I give
you permission to do so.’</p>

<p>‘Of course, Oom Hans, if it will spoil your chance of
getting a good price for the mineral rights, I will say
nothing about it. But what is the good of keeping it
secret? You ought to make it known as much as possible,
then you will be able to get the highest offer.’</p>

<p>‘Stephaans, you do not seem to understand. I do not
want to sell the mineral rights of my farm, nor the farm
itself. I only wish to live quietly and at peace on my
farm.’</p>

<p>‘But why so, Oom Hans? Consider the price you
could get for a farm with quartz on it like this?’ said
Steve, taking out a piece of the quartz he had put in his
pocket in the morning. ‘You could buy a dozen other
farms for the money, and have still enough left to live
on to the end of your days.’</p>

<p>‘I do not want any more riches than I have. I have
enough to live on, and enough to leave my children
when the Lord should take me away. Why should I
sell my farm? My father and mother lived and died
here. They are buried here, and here I wish to be
buried when I die. It is not good for us to have too
much of the riches of the world.’</p>

<p>‘But, Oom Hans, God has placed the gold there to be
used, and it would be sinful to leave it there, buried
under ground, or the Lord might say to you when the
time of reckoning comes, “I have given you so many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
talents of gold to work with, and to do good with, and
to win other talents with; but ye buried it under
ground and used it not as I directed ye, ye bad and
unfaithful servant, go forth into the outer darkness.”
Consider, Oom Hans?’</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>‘No, Stephaans, we do not see the matter in the same
light. When I feel that the Lord wishes me to leave my
farm, and let the gold be dug, I will tear from my heart
the love I have for my home and my birthplace, and
leave it. But I do not feel so yet. No one will lose by
it; I shall be the only loser; but the loss I consider gain,
so long as I can keep my home unpolluted by the
drunken, the profane, the blasphemer, the canteen-keeper.
These you know are always to be found where
gold is being dug.’</p>

<p>And no amount of arguing or talking on the part of
Steve could induce the conservative old farmer to
change his views. He again made Steve promise not to
tell of the gold, lest the Government should take the bit
in its own mouth and proclaim his farm as public gold
diggings.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 id="CHAP_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="medium">THE JEW</span></h3>

<p>The following day Steve’s host had decided to go to
Johannesburg to arrange about the sale of some slaughter
bullocks. He invited Steve to go with him and act as interpreter.
Steve said he should enjoy the drive, and went.</p>

<p>After business was concluded, Steve and Oom Hans
were seated at a table in a <i>café</i>, partaking of some refreshments.
On the opposite side of the table were seated
two Jews, discussing some samples of quartz before them.</p>

<p>At last one of the Jews turned towards Oom Hans,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
with the usual insinuating familiar manner of the Jew
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Mijnheer, don’t you tink dis quartz is goot?
Dere ought to pe lots of gold in it?’</p>

<p>Oom Hans indulged in his usual quiet, good-natured
laugh, and, turning to Steve, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Let us make the hearts of these Jews ache a little.
Show them a piece of the quartz you put in your pocket,
but (aside) mind you don’t tell them our names or where
we live?’</p>

<p>Steve smilingly took out a piece of quartz&mdash;it was
by no means the best, and handed it to the Jews,
and asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘What do you think of that?’</p>

<p>The Jews took the quartz, looked at it, and nearly
jumped out of their boots from excitement when they
saw the richness of the quartz.</p>

<p>They laughed, they shouted, they danced. They
called for coffee, tea, lemonade, and a dish full of the
nicest cake in the establishment, and placed it before
the strangers, who carried <i>such</i> samples of quartz about
them.</p>

<p>‘<i>Eet, mijnheer, drink, mijnheer, ons zal betaal</i>’&mdash;‘eat
and drink master, we will pay.’</p>

<p>When they had quieted down, the Jews came and
seated themselves near to Steve and Oom Hans, and
started pumping operations.</p>

<p>‘Is dis quartz from your farram, mijnheer?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ was the uncompromising reply.</p>

<p>‘Where do you lif, mijnheer?’</p>

<p>‘In the Transvaal?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; put where? What district?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, in one of the districts?’ was the laughing
rejoinder.</p>

<p>‘Near what town, mijnheer?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, within a thousand miles of Johannesburg?’</p>

<p>The Jews laughed as if this was a very good joke.
They were confident of getting round this stupid old Boer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>‘Will mijnheer not have a drink&mdash;whisky, prandy, or
gin, whatever you like?’</p>

<p>‘No, thank you. We do not drink strong drink,’ interfered
Steve. They had not touched the refreshments
supplied by the Jews.</p>

<p>‘What is mijnheer’s name?’ continued Jew No. 2.</p>

<p>‘Hans?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; put Hans what?&mdash;your family name, I mean?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, just Hans; that is enough for you,’ said Oom
Hans, laughing. The eagerness of the Jews amused
him.</p>

<p>‘Well, look here, Mijnheer Hans, what will you take
for your farm?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing?’</p>

<p>‘What!’</p>

<p>‘Nothing?’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to sell it!’</p>

<p>‘Not at any price? I will give you a big price
for it.’</p>

<p>‘No; I do not want to sell at any price.’</p>

<p>‘Not for a hundred tousand pound? two hundred
tousand pound? five hundred tousand pound? Come,
if you show me a reef like that quartz on your farm,
I shall give you one million pounds. Don’t say no,
mijnheer&mdash;<i>Ten hundred tousand pounds?</i>’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t want your money.’</p>

<p>‘You tink I have no money! Come to the bank,
I will show you. You tink you get more from annuder
man. I tell you one million pound very much monies.
Ask the young man!’ pointing to Steve.</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t want your money. Come, Stephaans, let
us go.’</p>

<p>The Jew ran towards the door and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Don’t go yet, Mijnheer Hans. I give you what you
ask; you make your own price. Or I tell you what, you
keep your farm, you just tell me where it is, you show
me the place that sample comes from, and I will give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
you five tousand pound&mdash;ten tousand pound,’ eagerly
added the Jew, visions of a rich prospector’s mijnpacht
floating before his eyes.</p>

<p>Oom Hans was getting tired of this, as well as
annoyed at the Jew’s perseverance. He must get rid
of him.</p>

<p>‘I will think of it, and let you know to-morrow,’ he
said.</p>

<p>‘Where shall I see you?’</p>

<p>‘If I want to do business with you, I will come here
at ten o’clock to-morrow,’ was the non-committal reply.</p>

<p>Steve and Oom Hans went to the boarding-house,
where they had secured a room. They noticed that the
Jews followed them, and after having seen them into the
boarding-house, left again, apparently satisfied that they
could lay their hands on the old Boer when they wanted
him. But they counted without their host. The old
man paid his bill before going to bed; and when the
sun rose, he and Steve were far on their way home.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="medium">THE JEW AGAIN&mdash;DISCOURAGED</span></h3>

<p>Steve was once more in Pretoria. He had been for a
week back in work, when one evening, as he was walking
leisurely home from business, he heard an eager
exclamation of joy behind him. The next moment his
arm was firmly caught hold of, and he heard a Jewish
voice, not quite unfamiliar, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Oh, mine tarling poy, how I have looked for you;
oh, praise pe to father Abraham, I have found you.’</p>

<p>Steve’s hand was snatched up eagerly and joyfully
shaken. It was one of the Jews they had met in
Johannesburg.</p>

<p>‘Oh, how I have looked for you, mine frint. I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
made two horses tie, so I have rode them, to find you,
and your honest old frint. Come, come, let us go into
this bar and have a bottle of fiz.’</p>

<p>‘No, thank you, I do not take wine or spirits, and I
have no time now to talk to you,’ replied Steve, annoyed
at the scene the Jew was creating in the street, causing
the passing people to stand and stare at the vehement
joy of the Jew.</p>

<p>‘But, my frint, I must speak to you, I can’t let you go
now, after looking so long for you; I tell you I have
been everywhere trying to find you, from the day I saw
you in Johannesburg. Oh, no, I will not let you go;
you must speak to me, I have much to tell you.’</p>

<p>Steve saw it was no use trying to get rid of the Jew in
this way.</p>

<p>‘Come to my room, and do not talk so loud in the
street,’ said he, walking rapidly on, the Jew sticking to
him like a leech.</p>

<p>‘Now, quick, what do you want from me?’ said Steve,
as he handed the Jew a seat in his room.</p>

<p>‘Oh, come, you know I want to puy de gold farm of
your friend&mdash;what’s his name?’ said the Jew, thinking to
catch Steve off his guard.</p>

<p>‘Never mind his name now. As regards buying his
farm, he has already declined doing business with you.
Why do you pester me now about a thing that is settled?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he will sell to me, I shall give lots of money,
only tell me where I can find him, that is all I ask of
you?’</p>

<p>‘I certainly shall not tell you where to find him, so
you might as well go home.’</p>

<p>‘Look here, young man, you are not rich, I will make
you rich if you will only bring me to the farm, so that I
can speak to him myself. I will give you one tousand
pounds for only telling me the man’s name and address.’</p>

<p>The Jew mostly spoke with a fairly good accent, but
whenever he got excited, he dropped into his Jewish
accent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>‘I shall <i>not</i> give you his name and address, not for a
thousand pounds or more,’ was Steve’s reply. The Jew
looked surprised, but he thought Steve must be <i>sticking</i>
out for a better offer.</p>

<p>‘I shall give you two thousand pounds, only for a
name and address,’ he bid again.</p>

<p>Steve shook his head.</p>

<p>‘Young man, don’t tread your fortune under feet; you
will never get such an opportunity again; I shall make
you a good final offer now. Give me the name and
address, tell me where you got that sample of quartz
from, and I shall give you <i>five thousand pound</i>, and if I
secure it, I shall give you <i>ten thousand pound</i>, now is
your chance, take it.’</p>

<p>Steve smiled at the persistence of the Jew. He sat
thinking for a minute or two, while the Jew sat watching
him eagerly. At last he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I will tell you what I will do. I shall go out to-morrow
and see the gentleman. I will do my best with
him. If I can persuade him to see you, I will tell you
so the day after to-morrow; if you can succeed to buy
the farm from him, I will accept your offer, if not, then
I do not want your money. Good night.’</p>

<p>The Jew saw that he would get nothing more from
Steve, but he left perfectly satisfied apparently.</p>

<p>Steve obtained leave of absence for the following day
that same evening. The following morning he left early
on horseback.</p>

<p>Several times while riding on he fancied he heard hoof-strokes
behind him, but the country was undulating, and
covered with patches of trees, so that he could see a very
little of the road behind him; besides, he did not attach
much importance to the fact.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the farm of Oom Hans, he immediately
told him all the Jew had said and done. Oom
Hans was annoyed that the Jew should have discovered
Steve, and preached a little sermon to himself for having
indulged in what he considered at the time a little harmless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
pleasantry. But he could not help laughing that the
Jew should have been hunting for him so long and so
earnestly.</p>

<p>‘Well, Steve, if you think it hard on you that your
promise to me prevents you from accepting the Jew’s
offer of five thousand pounds for my name and address,
I will release you from your promise; tell him my name
and address, but I warn you I will make it hot for him
should he come here.’</p>

<p>‘Oom Hans, I hope you do not think so badly of me
as to think I would break my promise to you for five
thousand pounds. No, I will never tell the Jew unless
you change your mind as to the selling of the farm;
besides, it would be very dishonest to take the Jew’s
money, if I know that he will get nothing for it.’</p>

<p>At this moment a knock was heard at the door.</p>

<p>Oom Hans looked out of the window to see who it
was. He turned to Steve, with anger on his face, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘So, then, you come to me like a hypocrite, and
pretend that you come to ask my permission to give the
Jew my address, while all the time you had the Jew
waiting for you outside.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean, Oom Hans?’</p>

<p>‘Come and look for yourself.’</p>

<p>Steve looked, and there the Jew was standing on the
stoep, waiting for an answer to his knock. Steve remembered
the hoof-strokes he had heard behind him. He
saw that the Jew had been watching and following
him.</p>

<p>‘Oom Hans, I give you my word of honour that what
I told you was the truth, and that I know nothing of the
Jew’s being here, except that I think the knave has been
following me without my knowledge.’</p>

<p>Steve’s voice and manner conveyed the truth of what
he was saying to Oom Hans. He was believed. This
made the old man all the angrier with the Jew.</p>

<p>He went to the door, opened it, and looked at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Jew. The Jew flew towards him with open arms, and
an angelic smile of affection on his face.</p>

<p>‘Oh, mine frint, how I have wished for you,’ and the
Jew went on in a flow of affectionate terms.</p>

<p>Oom Hans coldly waved him off, and said, ‘Wait a
moment.’ He went in again, closing the door after him.
He went to a shelf, took down a rusty old elephant gun,
as large as a young cannon. He poured about a quarter
of loose gunpowder down the capacious barrel, rammed
down half a newspaper by way of a plug, and went out
again, putting on as severe a face as he could.</p>

<p>Steve came out now and took Oom Hans by the arm,
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘For God’s sake, Oom, don’t shoot the man!’</p>

<p>‘Be quiet, you fool!’ roared Oom Hans, and turning
round, he winked at Steve, giving him a momentary
smile to reassure him. Steve saw that it was only going
to be a farce, and not a tragedy, as he at first feared.</p>

<p>Oom Hans now turned to the trembling Jew, who
stood quaking with clasped hands, afraid to run, and
afraid to stay.</p>

<p>‘My God, these Boers are terrible when angry,’ he
muttered.</p>

<p>‘What do you say?’ roared Oom Hans.</p>

<p>‘I say, sir, that the Boers are the best people in the
world, and that the English are dogs.’</p>

<p>‘Say that again, and I shall send a bullet through you
in a moment. The English, sir, are our friends, while
they live at peace with us, so be careful what you say.’</p>

<p>‘The English are a good people, sir. Oh, yes, they
will always be the best friends of the Boers.’</p>

<p>‘Silence, you dog! You say that because you are
afraid of my gun. Now, look here, is that your horse
there?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, I will make you a present of him, if you want
him.’</p>

<p>‘Silence! I will count ten to give you time to get on
your horse, and ten to get out of gunshot, after that I fire.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, but, sir, I come to do pisness; I bring you lots of
monies. Just listen one word.’</p>

<p>‘One!’</p>

<p>‘One word only, sir,’ said the Jew, tears running down
his eyes.</p>

<p>‘Two!’</p>

<p>The Jew began to retreat, still praying for an interview.</p>

<p>‘Three!’</p>

<p>The Jew was now running.</p>

<p>‘Ten!’ he heard shouted at him, as he mounted his
horse. He waited no more after that, he used spur and
whip to urge his horse forward. He thought that he had
gone but a short distance, when he heard a report like
the report of a cannon behind him.</p>

<p>‘Oh, father Abraham, receive my soul,’ he prayed,
‘for I must be hit; a Boer never misses.’</p>

<p>He was surprised to feel no pain or wound.</p>

<p>‘Now, I must race, before he can load again,’ he
muttered, applying spur and whip with fresh energy, as
he lay forward on the neck of the horse.</p>

<p>When Steve and Oom Hans recovered from their fit
of laughter, into which they had fallen at the sight of the
Jew’s fear of a charge of loose gunpowder, they saw the
Jew disappearing on a rise about a mile away, his arm
still rising and falling as he lashed his horse furiously.
The Jew must have done the distance from the farm
to Pretoria in record time that day, as he was seen by
several people on the road, riding his horse at full speed,
looking back every minute to see if he was pursued.</p>

<p>He was never seen on that farm again.

<h3 id="CHAP_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="medium">HISTORY <i>A LA</i> RHODES</span></h3>

<p>We shall pass on now to more stirring times in the life
of Steve, who has grown into a strong young man of
twenty-seven years of age now. He has always borne in
mind the dying words of his father, and has never
neglected his weekly letter to his mother and sisters, or
his monthly contribution towards their house-keeping at
home. He had kept that part of his promise to his
father to the best of his ability. As to the patriotic
promise his father had obtained from him, that was
hardly ever out of his thoughts. Walking in the quiet
suburban walks in which he delighted, the thought of
his country and his race was ever with him. If he
could not sleep at night, the same thoughts occupied
his mind. And many a plan did he think out&mdash;only to
reject&mdash;as to how his people could be raised up to a
higher level as a nation, or how they were to be united
in all the states and colonies, as a free and united people.</p>

<p>He had watched the political events in South Africa
closely. He saw that the Republics were slowly being
driven into a corner by the great Imperialistic amalgamator.</p>

<p>He fancied that he could see how Rhodes was using
the Afrikander Bond of the Cape Colony to manufacture
a rope, which was intended to be used eventually to
strangle their own hopes of national existence.</p>

<p>There was only one doubt in his mind. Was Rhodes
working for Imperialism on behalf of the British Empire?
or was he so flattered by being called the <i>South African
Napoleon</i>, that he wanted to really earn that name, and
to build up a new empire, with himself as emperor?
However, whichever of the two was intended by Rhodes,
both must be resisted to the death. We neither desire
to be a united British colony, nor a united South African
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Empire. We wish to be a united South African Republic.
Such were Steve’s thoughts on the matter. But
everything seemed to be tending towards a crisis. He
felt that the time was not far distant when it would be
decided whether a great new nation would be formed
in South Africa by the fusion of the races, or whether
South Africa would be put down, and kept down as a
vassal state, for, perhaps, another decade, or maybe two
decades. He never doubted that in the end South
Africa would fulfil its destiny, and become a great Free
country.</p>

<p>Steve had watched with pain how the Republics were
robbed of all just claims for northern extension,
through delusive promises of eastern extension towards
the sea-coast. He had seen the formation of the British
South African Chartered Company; only another name,
he said, for an anti-Boer company.</p>

<p>He had seen how this company had dispossessed
Afrikander holders of concessions in Mashonaland.
How this company had robbed and deprived poor
Lobengula of country and life on the shallow pretence
of Matabele aggression in Mashonaland. Ah, if
a <i>Boer</i> republic had done what the Chartered Company
did in Matabeleland, how they would have
been reviled, how they would have been abused.
New names would have been invented to call the
Boers by, as the English language had already been
exhausted on them when they defended their own
country. How the Boers were called murderers, slaveholders,
and God knows what more, when they subdued
two rebellious chiefs in Zoutpansberg in the interest of
law and order. After having treated those two chiefs
with the greatest consideration and kindness, both before
and after their subjection, the Boer haters invented
lies and deeds of cruelty never perpetrated in order to
blacken the name of Boer before the world. But Rhodes
and his followers were called ‘Napoleons,’ ‘heroes,’ and all
sorts of high-sounding names, for doing what no Christian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
man in the world ought to have countenanced&mdash;shooting
down naked human beings, armed partly with comparatively
harmless assegais, or in their hands harmless rifles,
in hundreds and thousands, with Satanic inventions of
machine guns. Ah, God! how long wilt thou permit
the strong to murder the weak? All those hundreds and
thousands of poor innocent human beings were murdered
or driven starving from their homes, for the sole reason
to make a dividendless company pay dividends&mdash;Civilisation?
The sooner such civilisation is swept from off
the earth the better it would be for humanity in general.
It must be remembered that these Matabeles were not
rebels, but were fighting in defence of their own country,
which up to then had been free and independent.</p>

<p>Steve saw how the Chartered Company was not yet
satisfied. They must have Khama’s land too. Poor
Khama went to England to ask the Great White Queen
for protection, for he had had a terrible object lesson in
Lobengula, and knew what his fate would be. Khama
had a partial success. He was at least safeguarded
against total extinction by the Chartered Company.</p>

<p>The attention of the Chartered Company was now
given to the rich and free republic&mdash;the Transvaal&mdash;with
whom England held treaties of peace and amnesty. But
what does that matter to a Chartered Company, or to a
Rhodes, a Jameson?&mdash;we shall see!</p>

<p>Steve saw how all the injustice done to the Afrikander
race by England at Slachtersnek, in Natal, at Boomplaats,
Kimberley, and during all the existence of the Transvaal
as a Dutch Afrikander State, was finally capped by the
English in annexing Amatongaland.</p>

<p>Where does the injustice come in?</p>

<p>We have already seen how, through Mr Hofmeyr and
others, the Transvaal was promised the incorporation of
Swaziland with the Transvaal, and a passage to the sea
through Amatongaland, on condition that the Transvaal
gave up all rights towards northern expansion.</p>

<p>Transvaal subjects had obtained concessions in Mashonaland
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
previously to those obtained by the agents of
Rhodes. The Transvaal kept its promise. Transvaal
subjects were forced, by a proclamation issued by the
President, to stop a trek towards Manacaland to take
possession of country in that territory, ceded to them by
its legal owners; and Rhodes and company were left in
undisturbed possession. How was the agreement fulfilled
by the other side? Only after long, patient and
persevering waiting the Transvaal was at last reluctantly
allowed to incorporate Swaziland in a half-hearted sort of
way. But&mdash;</p>

<p>The Transvaal had obtained the cession of Amatongaland
from its legal owners&mdash;the chiefs of the tribes
living there. When the Transvaal asked England to
ratify the annexation of Amatongaland, according to
the agreement made with said chiefs, England refused,
on the plea that, if it should be decided later on that
Swaziland should fall to British rule, Swaziland would
be inaccessible to England, as it is almost surrounded
by Transvaal territory, and that Amatongaland was the
only passage open to Swaziland for England in such a
case. However, the Transvaal was given to understand
that its claim was <i>legitimate</i>; and that, in case Swaziland
was ceded to it, there would be no difficulty raised to
its expansion towards the sea <i>via</i> Amatongaland.</p>

<p>When Swaziland was given up to the Transvaal,
because England could hardly do otherwise, as Swaziland
belonged to the Transvaal by all the rules of
nations&mdash;Swaziland really belonged to the Transvaal,
was part and parcel of its territories, lying as it does
within its borders, having been kept out of it as a
protection (?) for the natives by treaty with England.
Well, what did England do when the Transvaal at last
had possession of Swaziland? Did she say to the
South African Republic, ‘Now you have Swaziland,
you might as well realise your <i>legitimate</i> desires for a
seaport; you had better have Amatongaland too, as it
means so much to you, and is really worthless to us.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Did she say that? <i>One morning the Government of the
South African Republic awoke to find that Amatongaland
had been annexed by England on the quiet.</i></p>

<p>The Transvaal had received no previous notice
from England of her unjust intentions in Amatongaland,
no&mdash;such a deed could hardly bear the light of
day to fall upon it before it was an accomplished fact;
once accomplished, possession is nine points of the
law.</p>

<p>South Africa was shocked at such a deed. The
Transvaal protested. The Orange Free State protested.
Even Natal and the Cape Colonial Government
were ashamed of the deed, and disowned all
knowledge of it.</p>

<p>Steve had taken note of all this and more.</p>

<p>He had seen how England had unwarrantably interfered
in a question which did not concern her in the
least. The Transvaal had closed certain drifts between
itself and the Orange Free State&mdash;mind you not between
the Transvaal and British territory&mdash;it was a
matter of policy to meet the machinations of the
Cape Colonial Government under Rhodes, who were
trying to strangle the railways of the Transvaal by
ox-waggon competition. England interfered, and told
the Transvaal that its Government had no right to
close those drifts&mdash;why? Because England says so, of
course! The Transvaal&mdash;once more to show its desire
for peace&mdash;<i>opened those drifts</i>.</p>

<p>We have only touched some of the main points South
African history for the last few years, so that we may be
understood as the story proceeds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="medium">THE REPTILE PRESS OF SOUTH AFRICA</span></h3>

<p>There was one thing which Steve had long noticed,
viz., that there could be no doubt of the existence of an
organisation formed for the purpose of <i>killing</i> the Transvaal
as a republic.</p>

<p>This organisation seemed to have taken for a motto,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘If you want to kill a dog, give him a bad name, and
nobody will object to your killing him.’</p>

<p>To achieve this dirty work, newspapers were started in
Pretoria, Johannesburg, and all over South Africa.
Only one line of conduct seemed to have been laid
down for the editors of these newspapers, viz.,&mdash;Paint the
Government of the South African Republic and Boers
generally with the blackest verbal paint you can invent;
the editor who can invent the most lies and write the
dirtiest libels on the Transvaal and on Boers that editor
shall receive the greatest reward.</p>

<p>This programme was well followed.</p>

<p>The amalgamator of mines and countries had chosen
his men well.</p>

<p>These editors must be in the possession of dictionaries
unknown to the rest of the world. Dictionaries with an
alphabetical list of all the bad names ever invented,
with the addition of some specially invented for the
occasion. The writers for the papers belonging to the
organisation for <i>painting Boers black</i> seemed to have a
special mode of writing their articles. A string of bad
names is selected, and manufactured into some tale of
Boer cruelty, duplicity, dishonesty, or something of the
sort.</p>

<p>This story would be published and taken up by the
various papers belonging to the organisation, and any
other paper in foreign lands which might be misinformed
enough to believe such stories. How England and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
rest of the world would be shocked with these tales.
How well-meaning people in distant England would cry
shame at these savage (?), cruel (?), and dishonest (?)
Boers. Ah! this cowardly, strike-a-man-behind-his-back,
blacken-a-dog’s-name-and-then-kill-him, Boer-hating,
anti-freedom, anti-republican organisation knew well
that England can yet boast of millions of honest, fair-minded
and well-meaning people, who would not allow
a free, peace-loving and God-fearing people to be trampled
under foot by a speculating, company-mongering, Matabele-exterminating
organisation. For this reason, the
Boer must first be blackened, his name must be made
to stink in the nostrils of the English and European
public. It must be made to appear a great deed of
chivalry to exterminate these <i>women-killing</i> (?), slave-dealing (?).
Uitlander-oppressing (?) Boers.</p>

<p>But the sequel has shown that there is a just Heaven
above, who watches over countries, empires, republics
and peoples as well as over individuals. The machinations
of these plotters were made to fall back upon their
own heads by a just God. They were made to fall into
their own pits, dug for others. Read on and see.</p>

<p>Although evidently directed from Cape Town, the
operations of the organisation were centred in Johannesburg,
as being the place where the materials to be used
for their purposes&mdash;<i>the Uitlanders</i>&mdash;were most plentiful,
and, also being in the heart of the Boer Republic, they
could strike more to the purpose.</p>

<p>Every pretext was made use of to find fault with Boers
and Boer government. Let them come across a God-fearing,
religious Boer, and he is described as a
hypocritical, sanctimonious, double-faced knave. If,
on the contrary, a Boer is met who moves with the
surrounding world, speculates, goes to entertainments,
or takes a drink at a bar, he again is called a drunken,
cheating, parasitical, half-civilised scoundrel.</p>

<p>Again, should the Government take righteous umbrage
at haughty and unjust demands from their particular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
party, and refuse them, the Government is called a
tyrannical, autocratic and oppressive government. Should
the Government again consider a request fair and just, or
tenable in any way, and grant it, then they are jeered at,
now they are beginning to be afraid and are obliged to
give way. Or, again, it was granted through favouritism,
or through bribery. Such was the one-sided criticism
indulged in.</p>

<p>Familiarity brings contempt. The Government got to
be so accustomed to this one-sided abuse, that they really
treated it with the contempt it deserved. This gave
courage to the black libellers.</p>

<p>Constant droppings will wear away a stone. The constant
hacking and pegging away at the Government
began to take effect on the Uitlander public. They began
to believe it, saying, ‘Where there is smoke there must
surely be fire?’ At least such was the effect on the least-informed
portion of the Uitlander population.</p>

<p>The first visible and material victory obtained by the
organisation was the <small>FLAG INCIDENT</small>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="medium">THE TRANSVAAL’S PRESIDENT AND FLAG INSULTED
BY THE UITLANDERS</span></h3>

<p>The President of the South African Republic is obliged
by law to visit outlying districts as much as possible,
in rotation, to ascertain the views, grievances and wants
of the public.</p>

<p>The turn of Johannesburg came to receive such a
visit. The President went there in order to give the
public an opportunity to state to him personally what
they wanted in the way of improvements generally.
If they had any wants or grievances to be redressed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
now was their time to say so, and obtain their desires
as far as was just and fair. Was this done?</p>

<p>No! When the President mounted the public platform,
he was received with groans and hootings. Paid
roughs caused a disturbance, which was taken up by
the lower element amongst the crowd, and the President
had to escape as best he could from the dastardly
roughs, who would not have scrupled to lay their hands
upon his person. The sacred, beloved flag of the Republic
was torn down and rent to shreds.</p>

<p><i>This was the way Johannesburg sought redress for their
grievances.</i></p>

<p>The loyal public were righteously enraged, and had it
not been for the conciliatory speeches of the President
later on, the Burghers would not have rested until due
revenge had been taken for the dishonour done the chief
of their Republic and their flag.</p>

<p>But the Government refused to punish the scoundrels;
they hoped to win the Uitlanders over by gentleness
and forbearance.</p>

<p>The next grand opportunity for the organisation to
revile the Government and the people came with the
Malaboch war.</p>

<p>A petty chief rebelled, causing general disorder in
the Zoutpansberg district, and setting a bad example to
the thousands and tens of thousands of natives living
in the district. Malaboch had to be subdued and made
to obey the laws of the land or the whole native population
would soon have been in rebellion. This was done.</p>

<p>Steve went as a volunteer on the expedition (he having
privately got the field cornet to commandeer him). He
saw with surprise with what consideration the rebels
were treated. They were regarded as a civilised nation;
and repeated offers of mercy were made them if they
would submit. An invitation was sent them to send
out their women and children for safety, which was
done, thereby prolonging the siege of the native stronghold,
as the provisions held out so much longer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>After the submission of the tribe, they were treated
with all kindness. They were conducted to Pretoria and
well provided for.</p>

<p>To prevent a repetition of the rebellion, and of their
retaking possession of their former almost inaccessible
stronghold, the native tribe was broken up (as per precedent
established by the English administration in
former years), and homes given them elsewhere.</p>

<p>The result of all this was that the Government was
abused more than ever before. It was affirmed that the
grossest cruelties had been perpetrated on the poor,
innocent natives; the Boers made slaves of the natives,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>The most ridiculous statement of all was that the
Boers ravished the native women! Anybody knowing
a Boer would know how impossible this is! A Boer
shrinks from touching the hands of the dirty, oily, reeking
native; how much more would he shrink from
<i>embracing</i> a native woman!</p>

<p>As we have said, Steve had been to the Malaboch
war himself. He had seen for himself the treatment
accorded the natives, and the lying statements published
all over the world made him shiver with disgust and
anger.</p>

<p>The following year, with the Magoeba campaign, the
same thing was repeated all over. The causes were the
same, the effects were the same. Sir E. Ashmead
Bartlette and others of his stamp (either deceiving, or
being deceived by others here) made ridiculous and untruthful
statements in the House of Commons, in public
speeches, or in the daily papers. All this was the result
of the wire-pulling, worked by the secret organisation for
‘painting Boers black.’</p>

<p>Finally, another grand opportunity came for a general
carnival of abuse and lies against the Government of
the country&mdash;the festivities in connection with the opening
of the Delagoa Railway.</p>

<p>Not that we mean to state that these were the only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
times when the Government was abused and libelled;
daily opportunities were found to distort facts; an anthill
was made into a mountain; a good deed into one
of the blackest imaginable. And when no facts could be
found to distort, something was invented by some fiendish
imagination. But the festivities offered a grand opportunity
for exaggerations and distortions.</p>

<p>The Government was made to spend thousands of
pounds sterling on favourites, contracts for decorations
were given to favourite Hollanders, money was wasted,
the Volksraad vote was greatly exceeded, and goodness
knows what besides. It is too sickening to enter into all
the petty lying faults that were found.</p>

<p>In this way the Government and people of the country
had daily to tamely and quietly hear themselves belittled
and besmeared with the lying libels of their foes; it was
all patiently and quietly borne; they wished for peace,
and were always conciliating. This was taken by the
opposition as signifying fear and conscious weakness.</p>

<p>Matters went on in this way until December 1895 was
reached. Steve was watching the approaching clouds.
He could hear the distant thunder. He could see that
a storm was coming, gathering force as it approached. A
crisis was at hand.</p>

<p>It was coming sooner than he could have wished. He
knew it was coming, but he would have liked it to have
come a few years later, when the Afrikander race, at the
rate they were strengthening now, would be considerably
stronger and more able to cope with their opponents.
But let it come. We shall do our best to conquer, and
if it is God’s will that we should come out victorious, all
praise be to Him. And if it be His will, <span class="smcap">We shall</span> be
victorious! If it be His will that we should be conquered,
His will be done; we can but die.</p>

<p>The secret organisation had lately taken more visible
and definite form. First, a National Union was formed
by a few in the secret. The innocent Uitlander public
were led by the nose. When a meeting was convened by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
the self-elected leaders of the so-called Union, the public
were only too glad to attend a meeting where some
excitement was promised them. They went to hear the
inspired spoutings of their self-elected leaders, and
cheered where they were expected to do so, or listened
indifferently to eloquent advocates, speculators, etc.
Many of them were surprised to be told that they
really had any grievances. They had always thought
they were better off in this country than they had been
in their own land; here they earned good wages, paid
little or no taxes, and were left alone and in peace;
while in their own countries, they earned very little, of
which little they had to pay a large percentage in taxes
and rates of one kind or another.</p>

<p>But these learned men say we have grievances;
they ought to know! And if we really have any wrongs
to be redressed, the sooner it is done the better; so
hurrah for these philanthropic (?) gentlemen who are
going to redress our wrongs. They say we ought to
have the franchise, so the franchise we will have, and
so on.</p>

<p>It went uphill, it is true; the agents of the organisation
found great difficulty to get the public mind wound
up to the right pitch, and when they did succeed for an
hour or so to get an enthusiastic audience together, it
only lasted for that brief hour.</p>

<p>But even for this want of enduring enthusiasm a
remedy was found, viz., a committee was appointed
who were supposed to represent the Uitlander population,
who made up in themselves for all want of public
enthusiasm. Gold could do a great deal; besides, the
head of the organisation knew the art of <i>buying</i> enthusiasm.</p>

<p>For a time the National Union took a spurt, kept alive
by inflaming speeches and circulars; but as soon as a
little boom in shares took place, the public would have
nothing to do with politics, and again and again the
committee found the Union to consist of <i>themselves</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
This would never do; the objects of the Union would
never be attained if something was not done soon.</p>

<p>The plans of the parent organisation were nearing
completion. Soon it was rumoured that the president
of the Union and other members of the secret organisation
were preparing to issue a manifesto, by which
means they hoped to once more wind up public opinion,
and to inflame the hotter Boer haters to the fullest
extent. When once the public were excited enough,
a meeting would be held, where revolutionary proposals
would be made by certain agents, which, it was hoped,
would be taken up and supported by the public. This
was December 1895.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="medium">THE NATIONAL UNION MANIFESTO</span></h3>

<p>It is Christmas 1895.</p>

<p>Peace on earth, good-will to all men is supposed to
prevail at this season; not so with the enemies of the
country.</p>

<p>The President was away on one of his yearly visits
to outlying districts. He would return on Boxing Day,
expecting everybody to be indulging in the usual festivities
of the season.</p>

<p>Alas! it is not so in a certain building in Johannesburg.
A group of men are exulting over a document.
It is a proof of the famous National Union Manifesto,
issued by the chairman of the Union; issued in the
name of the Uitlander population, without their consent.
On their own responsibility, the chairman of the Union
and a few of his fellow-conspirators issued a manifesto
with the full and deliberate intention of causing a civil
war in South Africa, a war of races&mdash;a war, the result of
which, and the ending of which, no man could surmise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>Steve went to the station on Boxing Day to see the
President arrive by train from his tour. As he was
standing talking to an acquaintance about the air of
mystery and expectancy on the faces of most people
in the crowd, he heard a newsboy crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<i>The Star! The Star! National Union Manifesto!</i>’</p>

<p>‘Hillo! I might as well buy a copy and see what they
have to say,’ he remarked, calling the boy and buying a
paper. He read it with the closest attention.</p>

<p>The manifesto was composed of several newspaper
columns of close printing.</p>

<p>What struck Steve was that, of all the grievances
detailed in the manifesto, only one was really worth complaining
about, viz., the want of franchise. All the rest
were open to difference of opinion, or did not exist at all.
After a great deal had been said on one subject or
another, a list of ten wants was given:&mdash;</p>

<p>Firstly.&mdash;‘The establishment of <i>this</i> Republic as a true
Republic,’ I wonder if the compiler of the manifesto is
an Irishman. He wants a republic to be made a republic;
he wants a cow to be turned into a cow; a horse
into a horse; a mule into a mule. Why he ought to
know that if he <i>is</i> a mule, a mule he is.</p>

<p>Secondly.&mdash;‘A Grondwet or constitution is wanted,
which shall be framed by competent persons.’ Who?
The committee of the National Union, I suppose!
No more need be said.</p>

<p>Thirdly.&mdash;‘An equitable franchise law, and fair representation.’
This is the only real grievance that the Union
could complain of. But then a poor man sometimes
complains because another man is rich and possessed of
more than his share of this world’s goods. The rich man
had patiently worked for and acquired his wealth, the
poor man will not work and will not wait for his time to
come to make his ‘pile.’ Let the Uitlander bide his
time patiently and earn the right to obtain the franchise,
and obtain it he will in the end. We all wish for the
franchise and hope to get it by proving to the Government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
that we wish it well and not harm. But who is going to
impoverish himself to enrich his neighbour? Who, when
attacked by an enemy, is going to hand over his own
revolver to be shot with? That is what the National
Union has proved itself to be up to now&mdash;<i>enemies</i> pure
and simple of the Government. Let them show more
good-will, more conciliation, more honest friendship,
and they may expect more consideration from the
Government.</p>

<p>Fourthly.&mdash;‘Equality of the Dutch and English language
is demanded.’ This is a Dutch republic, founded
by the Dutch, civilised and reclaimed by the Dutch.
Dutch is the official language of the country. The English
language is given all consideration in courts of law and
public offices. English is spoken freely everywhere, in
courts of law or other offices of administration. The
law is winked at as regards enforcing the use of Dutch.
More cannot be claimed at present. If the English
language wins its way into further favour no one is going
to grumble.</p>

<p>Fifthly.&mdash;‘Responsibility to the legislature of the heads
of the great departments.’ That is going to come without
the aid of the National Union!</p>

<p>Sixthly.&mdash;‘Removal of religious disabilities.’ The law
of the country allows every man to worship and think as
he pleases. Only, the holders of office and public officials
must be Protestants. <i>The Transvaal Burghers are mostly
descended from Huguenots!</i></p>

<p>Seventhly.&mdash;‘Independence of the courts of justice,
with adequate and secured remuneration of the judges.’
Even so, we all want that, and are thankful to say ‘we
have it.’</p>

<p>Eighthly.&mdash;‘Liberal and comprehensive education.’
The State has been striving and aiming towards this
laudable object for years, and is striving for it still.
Improvements in the department of education are made
yearly, and, let us hope, will be continued to be made.</p>

<p>Ninthly.&mdash;‘Improved civil service and provisions for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
pension fund’ is asked. I wonder if the members of the
National Union committee had an eye for their own future
prospects when they asked for this. Of course they were
going to be provided for in the way of offices in the improved
government and civil service, and they naturally
wished to make provision for their pensions.</p>

<p>Tenthly.&mdash;‘Free trade in South African products.’
Free trade is an old question, and need not be discussed
here. If it suits one party it does not suit another, and
the products of the State must be protected.</p>

<p>Something like the above were the mental comments
of Steve as he read the ‘Ten Wants’ of the Union. He
saw no harm in the ventilating of their wants by the
Union, if it is done peacefully and constitutionally, but
the implied threat which appears in the question ‘How
shall we get it?’&mdash;that is where he sees the spirit of the
manifesto. There is no reason why they should not get
all, or nearly all, they ask, if they ask for it in the right
way. It all depends upon what they decide to do to get
it whether they get it or no; under <i>threats</i> they will <i>not</i>
get it.</p>

<p>The meeting to be held on the 6th January 1896 had
to decide.</p>

<p>At last the train with the President on board steams
into the station. A line is formed from the saloon
carriage to the President’s private carriage, and the
Transvaal ‘Grand Old Man’ steps forth, hat in hand,
bowing right and left. As Steve gazes upon that firm,
calm and strong countenance, all doubt as to the future
prospects of his race disappear. With <i>such</i> a man as
their leader, victory must attend them. He gazes with
exultation upon Paul Kruger; he had often seen the
President before, but he looked upon him with renewed
interest after reading that bouncing manifesto; and as he
looked, he fancied he saw before him a stormy sea, the
billows roar, the winds blow, and amidst all a strong,
firm, upright rock receiving the dashing waves and
howling winds against its sides, unmoved. Such was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
the impression Paul Kruger gave Steve that afternoon.
The <i>simile</i> was not out of place; the storm was gathering.
<i>Will Paul Kruger remain firm?</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_X">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="medium">A FISHING PARTY ON THE VAAL RIVER</span></h3>

<p>From the time of publication of the National Union
Manifesto, a cloud seemed to hang over the country.
On every street corner and under every verandah where
two or three were gathered together, politics were being
spoken of. What is going to happen? Was Johannesburg
really going to take the bit in its own teeth and
go its own way, or was it all only big talk and a case of
the Union playing the bogey man to frighten the Government
into submission and into giving way to their demands.
There <i>were</i> a few fiery-minded youths in
Pretoria who talked big of the mighty things the
Uitlanders were going to do. They were armed; they
had twenty Maxims, cannons and small arms in plenty;
they were going to remove the Boer Government and
raise a government of their own, etc., etc.</p>

<p>But the majority of the Uitlanders living in Pretoria
expressed their intention to stand by the present Government.
They were not going to have either the Imperial
Government again, or a government of capitalists. The
former had made too many mistakes in South Africa already
to be desired; besides, are we not men, cannot we
work out our own salvation? As to the latter, enough of
that has been seen in Europe, America and Kimberley.
No, we are satisfied with the present Government, and
with the improvements we know that we shall get soon.
The Government received daily assurances from leading
Pretoria men of staunch support in case of need. Even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
in Johannesburg, the Government was not in want of
many thousands of Uitlander friends.</p>

<p>One hardy old Scotchman, interviewed by a countryman
lately arrived, in answer to the question as to what
his intentions were in case of disturbances, replied by
pointing to a gun standing in a corner and saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘You see that gun? Well that gun and myself are at the
service of Oom Paul whenever he wants us. I am not
going to see such an unrighteous thing as deposing a just
and kind Government by a lot of capitalists and other
knaves.’</p>

<p>Steve, amongst many others, never for a moment supposed
that any disturbance or breach of the peace would
take place before the 6th January, which was the date
appointed by the National Union for their great meeting,
when they would decide upon future action. How was
he or the general public (mostly concerned) to know of
the secret preparations (whispered of, but not believed)
made by the conspirators to let the dogs of war&mdash;and that
civil war&mdash;loose on or before the date appointed? How
was he or they to know that preparations were far advanced
for the invasion of the Transvaal by Chartered
troops? The different Governments concerned did not
know of it; how could private individuals know?</p>

<p>So Steve and his friends made preparations for a fishing
party during the New Year holidays on the Vaal River.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Saturday night saw Steve and his friends
embarked on the Cape train <i>en route</i> for the Vaal River.
They were going by rail as far as Vereeniging, from which
place they had made arrangements to leave by a mule
waggon, which they had chartered for the week. Arrived
at the border town, they loaded their tent and provisions
on the mule waggon, expecting to have a quiet but enjoyable
picnic on the banks of the Vaal. The site for their
camp was chosen about eighteen miles west from Vereeniging,
as they wished to be away from the bustle of town
life for the few days of rest. Sunday afternoon saw the
party comfortably settled on a pretty spot on the river’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
bank. A few beautiful trees supplied them with the
necessary shade from the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon and evening were spent in quiet rest,
after the necessary operations of fixing up camp were
over.</p>

<p>Monday morning early, fishing was begun in earnest.
A fairly successful day was spent on the river bank. Towards
sundown the party returned to camp.</p>

<p>After coffee had been made and partaken of, Steve
proposed that they should go to the little country store,
lying about half-a-mile away.</p>

<p>‘It will be a nice little walk before supper,’ he remarked,
‘and, besides, we might hear some news from the
shopkeeper, as he is the post-agent here.’ His proposal
was accepted, and the party strolled forth. Arrived at the
store, they found the proprietor to be one Nande. This
Nande was an Afrikander born, but an English educated
young man; handsome, stout, and well spoken, but slightly
deaf. As to his character, that will be sufficiently gathered
from his conversation and acts.</p>

<p>After a few trifling purchases had been made in the
store, as a sort of introduction, Steve inquired if he had
heard any news from Pretoria or Johannesburg to-day.</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, I have heard news, and if it is true, I shall
be jolly glad; it will show these miserable Boers that the
British people are not to be trifled with. I hear that
Jameson has entered the Transvaal with eight hundred
troopers, and is marching on to Johannesburg at full
speed; it is only a rumour as yet, I heard it at the
station this afternoon.’</p>

<p>At the first few words Steve trembled with agitation
and apprehension for the Transvaal, for, if this was true,
it really meant war with Great Britain, for Jameson and
his men were really British troops. But a moment’s reflection
showed him how improbable such a thing must be.
He could not believe England capable of such perfidy.
The Transvaal was at peace with England, and had done
absolutely nothing to provoke an invasion, or even a talk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
of an invasion from England. Besides, the last decade
of the nineteenth century was not a time when one civilised
country invades another, unprovoked and without
rhyme or reason. No, the wish was only father to the
thought, it was not to be believed for a moment. But
what struck Steve with disgust was that this young man,
who looked like an Afrikander, appeared to wish for such
an invasion, and seemed to glory in the very idea of it.</p>

<p>‘May I ask what your name is, sir?’ he said, turning
to the storekeeper.</p>

<p>‘My name is Nande.’</p>

<p>‘But that is a pure Afrikander name.’</p>

<p>‘So it is. I was born in the Cape Colony, and have
been in the Transvaal now for five years.’</p>

<p>‘But why do you speak as if you wished for the downfall
of our Afrikander Republic?’</p>

<p>‘Because I do not think it right that we should be
governed by these Boers any longer. Why, they refused
to give me a situation just because I could not write
Hollander-Dutch; they rather gave it to a Hollander
than to an Afrikander.’</p>

<p>‘I think that shows their good sense,’ replied Steve;
‘if you had learned your mother tongue as well as you
did English, they would not have refused you.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I only hope that Jameson and the Uitlanders
will succeed in chucking the whole lot out, then a man
who has received an English education will be able to
get a Government situation too. I hope to see the
British flag flying once more over the Transvaal in a
week or so.’</p>

<p>‘Hurrah for Jameson and the British flag!’ cried
Steve’s cousin.</p>

<p>This young man had been in the habit of running the
English down ever since he had come to the Transvaal,
because he thought it good policy, but now that he
believed the English were going to be victorious, he
thought it was high time to put on his Anglo-Saxon
coat and go with the winning party. It is all very well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
to be an Afrikander while Afrikanderism is popular, and
while Afrikanders hold the handle of the knife. But
now it seems England is going to wrest the handle out
of the hands of the Boers, so ‘British I will be now,’ was
his philosophy&mdash;ugh!</p>

<p>Keith and Harrison did not say a word; they seemed
to be stricken dumb at what they heard.</p>

<p>‘Oh, so you are taking a fit of Anglo-mania, too, now&mdash;you&mdash;cur,
you&mdash;dog, you coward.’</p>

<p>‘And I am a Britisher too, and I also say Hurrah for
Jameson,’ cried Nande.</p>

<p>Steve stood with clenched hands, pale as death.</p>

<p>‘And I say that the man who turns his coat and
stands away from his countrymen in their time of need
is worse than a <i>dog</i>, is worse than a Kaffir, for even a
Kaffir will stand by his people in time of need. You are
both dogs&mdash;<i>curs</i>, and worse than curs, you mongrel
Afrikanders.’</p>

<p>‘Look here, young man, you must be careful what you
say; you must remember we are four against you alone;
we will soon take your gas out of you,’ said Nande.</p>

<p>‘Come on then all of you. One true Afrikander can
always <i>down</i> half-a-dozen cowardly curs like you. I do
not believe a hundred like you would have the pluck to
tackle one single Boer. Come on, I am ready for you.’</p>

<p>He stood with his back against the wall, with clenched
fists, fierce set face, and gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>Nande snatched an axe handle standing near, and
crying to the other three to ‘come on and let us silence
this miserable Boer,’ he walked in a threatening way to
within three paces of Steve. Steve stood calmly but
determinedly awaiting the attack. When Nande stopped
three paces in front of him, Steve looked him full in
the eyes. Nande could not stand that look; he trembled
with fear, and looking away, he turned to the others and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Are you fellows not going to help me to give this
Boer a good thrashing?’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>Keith and Harrison looked contemptuously at him,
the former remarking that,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘If any help were required, we would certainly give it to
Steve. <i>He</i> is a <i>man</i>. You are a cowardly renegade. I
would be ashamed of you, if you really were an Englishman.’</p>

<p>‘Thank God there are very few Afrikanders such as
these two,’ said Steve. ‘It would be a bad lookout for
us if there were many such.’</p>

<p>‘You are right, Steve,’ said Harrison. ‘They are
about the only two I have ever met. I wish I had the
privilege to be a born Afrikander. I would not thus
turn renegade, but would be only too happy to fight for
my country; and, by God, if this is true about Jameson,
I <i>will</i> fight for them. If Englishmen can act as
treacherously as this, then I shall disown my own
country and become a true citizen of this, my adopted
country; that, at least, would not be turning renegade,
for I should be fighting for the country I live in.’</p>

<p>‘And so say I, too,’ said Keith.</p>

<p>Nande, seeing how the land lay, and the mistake he had
made when he expected to be supported by the young
Englishmen, backed out, and retreated behind his counter.</p>

<p>The party now left, and returned to their camp with
Steve’s cousin slinking on behind them. He kept out
of Steve’s way for the rest of the evening, as he saw that
he was in the minority now, and that was not a <i>rôle</i> he
delighted in playing.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAP_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="medium">NEWS OF AN UNEXPECTED INVASION AND BREAK UP
OF THE FISHING PARTY</span></h2>

<p>The next day fishing was resumed. Steve did not
attach much credence to Nande’s story of Jameson’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
invasion, so he was not much disturbed about it. He
thought he had plenty of time to enjoy his little holiday
and to be back home by the 6th January, when he would
be able to watch events and be at hand in case his services
were needed to defend his country.</p>

<p>What a surprise awaited him!</p>

<p>As the party returned about midday to camp for
lunch, they found a young man there who had just
drawn rein for a moment to let his sweating horse
breathe, and get a drink of water for himself.</p>

<p>‘Hillo! Whither away in such a hurry?’ hailed Steve
in a hospitable way. ‘Stay and have lunch with us.’</p>

<p>‘I dare not. I am in a great hurry. Have you heard
the news?’</p>

<p>‘No; what is it?’</p>

<p>‘Jameson has invaded Transvaal territory, and is
marching on to Johannesburg.’</p>

<p>‘My God! is it true after all?’</p>

<p>‘Only too true. I am postmaster and telegraphist at
H&mdash;&mdash;, and I have just received a wire from headquarters
to let the field cornet know at once, with orders
for him to <i>commandeer</i> every available Burgher without a
moment’s delay. They are to guard the borders against
any further invasion from any other direction. The
Burghers from Potchefstroom, Rustenburg and Krugersdorp
are ordered to intercept Jameson and to capture
him before he enters Johannesburg.’</p>

<p>‘May I know your name, sir?’ asked Steve.</p>

<p>‘Certainly; my name is A&mdash;&mdash;n.’</p>

<p>‘But that is a British name, is it not?’</p>

<p>‘It is; but I am colonial born, and I consider myself
an Afrikander, and I am going to stand by the
Afrikanders to the bitter end. My God! do you think
I will stand by and see our Republic invaded in such a
treacherous manner, and not do all in my power to resist
it? I am not obliged to bear dispatches in this way,
but for such a cause I would do a great deal more.’</p>

<p>‘I am proud to shake hands with you, sir,’ said Steve,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
suiting the action to the word. ‘With such men as you
to stand by us, our future is assured.’</p>

<p>‘I am glad to see you’re one of us, sir, and hope to
meet you again in more peaceful times; in the meanwhile,
now my horse has had a breathing spell, I must
hurry on.’</p>

<p>‘One moment, sir,’ said Steve. ‘I want to leave at
once for the scene of action. Which is the best way, do
you think, to reach it?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose, to take train as far as you can, and where
you find yourself stopped, to get a horse (the best way
you can), and go on horseback until you reach the place
where fighting is going on.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir. Good-bye, and God speed the Republican
cause.’</p>

<p>‘Amen, good-bye, and good luck.’</p>

<p>Steve was intensely excited, his breath came in short,
quick gasps. He turned to Keith and Harrison, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Look here, you chaps, I do not know what you intend
doing, but I can’t stay here another hour, I must get
away without a moment’s unnecessary delay.’</p>

<p>‘But, Steve, what could you do if you did go? One
man more or less will make no difference. Stay and let
us finish our fishing. Time enough to go fighting when
we have to go back and our holiday is over.’</p>

<p>Steve shook his head, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘No, old man, if everybody were to say that, and
want to enjoy their New Year festivities before responding
to their country’s call, then Jameson would have an easy
march to Johannesburg. No, I must go. The only
question is, How? Will you fellows go too, or will you
stay and let me have the mule waggon to the station, then
I can send it back to you, and you can stay here and
have the full benefit of your holiday.’</p>

<p>‘No, Steve, if go you must, I go too,’ said Keith.</p>

<p>‘And I will go too. If there is going to be excitement
on, we might as well be at hand and see what is going
on?’ said Harrison. ‘As to fighting, I do not yet know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
what I shall do personally, but one thing I am sure of,
I am not going to fight against the Boers. If they have
to be suppressed, I will take no hand in it, while I may
yet decide to fight with them; for if they are really
invaded in this back-handed, treacherous way, the
sympathy of all right-minded people ought to go with
them.’</p>

<p>‘Well, if we are to go, the sooner the better,’ said
Keith, responding kindly to Steve’s wishes.</p>

<p>The driver was called, and told to get the mules
and inspan at once, while the rest of the party busied
themselves in getting everything packed and ready for
their departure.</p>

<p>Steve’s cousin was not consulted as to his willingness
to leave or not; he was in the minority and had to accept
the decision arrived at; he was sulking on one side,
refusing to render assistance in the preparations for
leaving. He was undecided what to do; he was not
quite sure yet whether the Boers were going to lose or
not, so he thought he would keep quiet a little longer,
and see in which way matters tended. No notice was
taken of him by the others.</p>

<p>In a short time the driver’s assistant arrived with a
message to the effect that the mules were lost and must
have strayed away. The driver had gone farther to
search for them. Steve was in despair.</p>

<p>‘My God!’ he cried, ‘what have I done that this
should come to me? Would that I had never left
Pretoria, then I might at least have been able to do
something.’</p>

<p>‘Keith, come with me like a good fellow and help me
to bribe Nande into selling or hiring me a horse. I <i>must</i>
get away.’</p>

<p>‘I will go with pleasure, Steve; but I am afraid that
after last night’s scene, Nande will by no means be eager
to render you a favour.’</p>

<p>They went, but in vain. Nande was still feeling very
sore at the straightforward words of Steve, and refused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
absolutely to let him have a horse on any terms whatever.
Steve offered to pay any price, but in vain. He
attempted threats, but Nande was strong in the knowledge
that in this case, law was on his side, and that
Steve could not force him to give up his horse.</p>

<p>‘Well, Keith, old man, I am going to walk. Good-bye,
and thank you for your kindness.’</p>

<p>Keith remonstrated in vain, telling him to wait until
the mules were found, and that he could never arrive in
time to catch the train if he walked, but Steve was mad
with excitement. He felt that inaction was impossible;
he must do something, and with one handshake he
started on his way on foot. He walked fast and long.
It soon began to rain, but he walked blindly on, on and
on. ‘I must get on. If my people must fight for
liberty I must be with them.’ He did not heed the
water running into his shoes or streaming down his
clothing. The road was very indistinct; the water was
running over it, so that he was not sure always whether
he was on the road or not. It was getting dark. Surely
he ought to have reached the station by this time. He
had walked six long hours, and he must have covered
more than eighteen miles now. Where can the town
be? He could barely walk now, he was so tired and so
wet, but on and on he struggled. The strongest human
passion possessed him: the passion of outraged patriotism.
At last he saw a small building in front of him; it was
only a small place, but he hoped to find somebody
from whom he might inquire his whereabouts. He did
find a man there.</p>

<p>‘Will you please tell me where I am, sir. I am afraid
I have lost my way. I want to go to Vereeniging.’</p>

<p>‘Why, sir, you are walking away from Vereeniging.
You are about twenty-five miles from the station now.
Where are you coming from?’</p>

<p>‘I left about one o’clock from Nande’s Store on the
Vaal River. I am afraid I must have taken the wrong
road.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, you must have taken the left instead of the right
hand road, a few miles after you left Nande.’</p>

<p>‘My God! what shall I do now?’</p>

<p>‘Where do you wish to go to?’</p>

<p>‘I want to reach Johannesburg or Krugersdorp as
soon as possible.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you are at least twenty miles nearer your
destination now than when you left Nande, so your
time is not altogether lost.’</p>

<p>‘Sir, will you not do me a great favour by selling or
hiring me a horse, or tell me where I can get one near
by; it is most important that I should lose no time.’</p>

<p>‘I am very sorry, but I have no horse; you might get
one three miles away, where there is a Boer farm. They
have several horses; but come in and have a cup of
coffee first. You are wet and cold. I will give you some
of my dry clothing to put on in exchange for your wet
ones. It would be death for you to keep those wet
clothes on.’</p>

<p>Steve accepted with pleasure. He was wet, tired and
hungry. He had had nothing to eat since breakfast, as
the news received at lunch time had taken away all idea
of eating. He entered, had a cup of coffee with a dry
biscuit, changed his clothes, and, in spite of his host’s
invitation to spend the night there, departed.</p>

<p>‘No thank you, sir. I thank you for your kindness to
me, a stranger. If at any time you come to Pretoria,
here is my card. If I can return your kindness, please
let me know.’</p>

<p>He proceeded in the direction pointed out to him and
soon arrived at the Boer farm. It was a well-appointed
substantial building, and it was evident that well-to-do
people lived there, so no doubt he would be able to get
a horse.

<span class="medium">OFF TO THE WAR&mdash;A NIGHT’S RIDE&mdash;TERRIBLE NEWS</span></h3>

<p>When about two hundred yards away from the house,
Steve came across an old bushman with a pail of milk in
his hands, evidently coming from the cattle kraals.</p>

<p>‘Naand, baas.’ (Good evening, baas).</p>

<p>‘Good evening, my boy. Who lives here?’</p>

<p>‘Baas Meyer lives here, baas.’</p>

<p>‘Is your baas in?’ Steve asked.</p>

<p>‘No, my baas left with his two sons this afternoon, on
commando. They say the English are coming to take
the country again, and my baas left to fight the English.’</p>

<p>‘Who is at home now?’</p>

<p>‘Only the <i>nooi</i> (mistress) and her daughter.’</p>

<p>‘What is your name?’</p>

<p>‘Jankie, baas.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Jankie, here are two shillings for you.’</p>

<p>Steve thought it best to make friends where he could.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, thank you, baas,’ said the bushman, receiving
the coin and slipping it into his mouth.</p>

<p>‘Look here, Jankie, is there a good riding horse in
the stable?’</p>

<p>‘Only young Baas Willim’s horse, on which he goes
courting.’</p>

<p>‘Is it a good horse, Jankie?’</p>

<p>‘I have never seen a better one, baas; it is a black
stallion. He never gets <i>flamed</i> (never gives in).’</p>

<p>‘That is just the horse I want, Jankie. Do you think
your mistress will lend him to me to go and fight the
English?’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid not, baas. Young Baas Willim never
allows anyone besides himself to ride that horse; but
come in and ask the <i>nooi</i>.’</p>

<p>Steve went up to the house and knocked. The door
was opened by a pretty, fair-haired girl, evidently the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
daughter of the house. He was shown into the sitting-room,
the good and well-appointed furniture of which
again indicated the wealth of the owners.</p>

<p>Steve asked to see Mijf Meyer. She soon appeared,
and without much beating about the bush, Steve stated
what he required.</p>

<p>‘Madam, I was on a picnic on the Vaal River. There
I heard that the English were again invading the country.
I want to go and fight against our enemies, but I have
no horse to go from here. Will you lend me one?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir; you look too much like an Englishman
yourself to go and fight against the English. Why do
you shame your face, just like the <i>rooi nekke</i>. No, sir, I
know your people’s tricks too well to be caught by you.
If a real Afrikander wants a horse to fight the English, he
can have all we have, but you look like one who is more
likely to help our enemies than to fight for us. I don’t
know you.’</p>

<p>Steve explained and expostulated, begged and
threatened, in vain. The old lady believed him to be a
spy and enemy. His looks were against him; and in any
case he was a stranger to her; and an Afrikander has
never been known to tramp about in city clothes like
his looking for a horse; she would neither sell nor
lend.</p>

<p>Steve saw that he was distrusted, and that further
pleading was in vain. He turned to leave, when the girl
came up to him, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Sir, you must excuse my mother, but we cannot risk
giving an enemy a horse to fight against our own people.
Perhaps you know how the Uitlanders have been
threatening us lately; my father and brothers are even
now on their way to fight against the English, who want
to take our country from us again. But if you want food,
or anything else, you are welcome.’</p>

<p>Steve thanked her, and told her he could not blame
them for distrusting a stranger. ‘But,’ with tears in his
eyes, ‘I do so long to be in the fight. I would dearly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
like to strike a blow for our liberty against our enemies,
and now I am so tired I can’t walk much farther, and
time is passing by. Oh, that I could find a horse.’</p>

<p>He walked out; he was in despair. The tears were
running fast down his face, and he was ashamed to let
the girl see him weep.</p>

<p>Steve did not walk more than a hundred yards away
from the house when he sank down on the ground in a
passion of tears and despair.</p>

<p>‘Oh, what have I done that I should be caged like
this? My countrymen are perhaps even now struggling
for life and liberty, and here I am in the open veld,
without a horse or means of reaching the commando in
time. Oh, my God, send me aid, help me to get away.
Oh, God, I would give all I have for a horse to-night.
Jesus, thou hast so often answered my prayers before,
answer me now, when I ask for a horse to go and fight
against our enemy.’ He shook with a passion of tears
and intense earnestness as he prayed in his despair.
Steve had great faith in prayer, and when all else failed,
he believed that God would not fail him. As he prayed
thus, a feeling of comfort and relief came over him; he
fancied he heard a voice say, ‘Fear not, my son, thy
prayer is heard.’ The next moment he felt a touch on
his arm; a pale face looked into his eyes. Steve saw
that it was the girl he had just left. She was weeping
now, too; a great faith in him was shining in her face.</p>

<p>‘Oh, forgive us for mistrusting you; I see now that
you are one of us. I stood looking after you, I saw you
were in trouble, and when I saw you drop down here, I
came to see what was the matter with you, and I heard
all you said in your grief and despair. Come with me,
God has heard your prayer.’</p>

<p>Steve was surprised at this turn of affairs. He followed
the girl. She led him to the stable and lighted a lantern.
In the lantern-light Steve saw a beautiful black stallion
standing. He thought to himself that Jankie had not
said too much for young Baas Willim’s courting horse.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
The girl showed him a saddle and bridle hanging on a
peg against the wall, and bid him put on the saddle.</p>

<p>‘But what will your mother say?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘I will answer for everything. It is for our dear country
and liberty you want the horse. If mother believed in
you as I do now, she would never have refused you. Be
quick now.’</p>

<p>Steve looked at her for a moment, but he reflected it
was for a great and noble cause, moreover it was urgent,
so he hesitated no longer. The horse was soon saddled
and led out of the stable. He took the girl by the hand
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘God bless you for your goodness. I hope I may earn
your good opinion in the struggle we are going to have.
I will try not to disgrace your brother’s horse. Good-bye,
and God bless you,’ and with a hearty handshake he
jumped on the horse.</p>

<p>‘Wait a moment,’ the girl called. ‘Which way are you
going?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p>‘I would advise you to go in the same direction our
Burghers went to-day. Take that road,’ pointing in a
northerly direction, ‘keep to the main road, and you are
sure to meet with some of the Burghers going to the
commando. They all expect the fighting to take place
somewhere between Johannesburg and Krugersdorp, so
you had better inquire your way to Krugersdorp first.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you. Good-bye.’</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, and good luck.’</p>

<p>Steve let go the rein, and the stallion, nothing loth,
shot forward like an arrow. But Steve was a good horseman,
he knew he had far to go, and a horse, however
good, is yet not a machine, therefore the strength of the
horse must be economised. He soon got the stallion to
settle down to a good, easy, comfortable pace at the rate
of six miles an hour.</p>

<p>As Steve sat on his pleasant, comfortable seat, with his
horse going as easy as a spring carriage, he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
much time for thought. It was a beautiful but weird
moonlight night. Thin, long streaks of mare’s-tail clouds
stretched across the sky, and Steve fancied he saw all
sorts of fantastical shapes in those clouds. He remembered
the old superstition that, when such clouds filled
the sky, somebody was dying? Who was dying? Was
it, perhaps, his countrymen, who, surprised by the sneaking
enemy, had been overcome and murdered? Who knows?
Perhaps a few score Burghers only had met the enemy, and
had been overcome. The postmaster of H&mdash;&mdash; had told
them that Jameson had Maxims and field-pieces; and
what could a hundred or two hundred Burghers do,
armed only with rifles, if they were to meet Jameson
and his eight hundred freebooters?</p>

<p>When such thoughts came to Steve, he would unconsciously
urge on his horse. ‘On&mdash;forward&mdash;who knows,
every man may mean the straw which might break the
camel’s back. Even I may do something which might
turn the tide of battle.’</p>

<p>With such and other thoughts Steve rode on. He
saddled off three different times for an hour before
day broke, to give his horse a rest and to allow him to
crop the grass along the road. Even this he grudged;
he wanted to go on, always on, but prudence taught
him to go slowly if he wanted to keep on going. Steve
saw that he really rode an exceptional horse. When
day broke, with the little rest he had had, the horse
seemed almost quite fresh.</p>

<p>When day came, Steve began to come up with straggling
parties of Burghers, who were moving forward as
rapidly as their different modes of travelling permitted.
He questioned some of them.</p>

<p>‘Your horse does not seem to be going very good,
uncle.’</p>

<p>‘No, he is not of the best; he can keep on, but he
can’t go very fast. If he could go as fast as the rest,
I should not be so far behind. All the best horses are
in front. The order of our field cornet is for every man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
to go as fast as he can; never mind those who stay
behind. You see there is no time to wait. Those
who can ride fast must go ahead and keep the enemy
busy until we come up.’</p>

<p>He next came to a party of six young men, dressed
in holiday attire, but on foot.</p>

<p>‘Hillo, <i>neefs</i> (cousins), are you off to the war too?’</p>

<p>‘You bet we are; you won’t catch us staying behind.’</p>

<p>‘But how is it that you have no horses; you do not
seem too poor to possess horses.’</p>

<p>‘No, but we were too far from home to go for our
horses. We had come by ox-waggon to spend New
Year’s Day at Oom Paulus Stichling’s, and when we
heard that the English had invaded our country again
we just set off on foot, and let Jameson just wait till we
come there we will show him, <i>waar David de wortels
gegrawen het</i>.’</p>

<p>Steve met many more such parties who had been
spending their New Year’s holiday from home, and who
had left just as they were to go and meet the enemy.
All the mounted Burghers he met were mostly of the
very poorest, who could not afford horses of the best
speed, and were consequently left behind. As Steve
saw that the order of the day was for every man to go
as fast as he could, and never mind those who stayed
behind, he thought he could do no better than follow
suit; consequently, he did not stand on any ceremony,
but rode on as fast as he thought prudent, leaving one
party after the other behind him.</p>

<p>About midday, he came to a small copse of trees,
which he thought just the place to saddle off for a good
rest for his horse and himself, as he felt a little tired by
this time, and as he was somewhat more reassured now, and
the excitement he had felt was a little worn off; he also
began to feel a little sleepy. He decided to knee-halter
his horse and sleep for an hour, after which he would
again proceed. As he was taking the saddle off, he
thought he heard voices a little deeper in the copse. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
knee-haltered his horse and went to see who was there.
He saw two boys of about twelve years of age, gun in
hand, sitting eating slices of bread and butter.</p>

<p>‘Well, sonnies, and where are you off to?’</p>

<p>‘Going to fight Jameson.’</p>

<p>‘<i>What?</i>’</p>

<p>‘Are you deaf, uncle? We are going to fight
Jameson.’</p>

<p>‘Does your pa know that you are going to the war?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, our parents are all away; my father and his
(nodding towards his companion) are both gone to the
war. They left us to look after the house, but as soon
as they were gone, we each took a gun and followed; <i>we</i>
are not going to stay at home while the old people fight,
ha! ha!’</p>

<p>‘Well you are the right kind of Afrikanders, you are
no cowards; the English will never take our country
while our young men have such patriotism,’ and Steve
felt proud to shake hands with these youngsters; he saw
that in such a spirit lay the strength of his nation.</p>

<p>The boys, with the usual spirit of Afrikander hospitality,
offered to share their bread and butter with Steve.
He gladly accepted a slice, as he had eaten nothing since
the evening before, when he had had a biscuit and a cup
of coffee with the stranger.</p>

<p>After the boys had finished their dinner, they
shouldered their guns and resumed their journey, while
Steve laid himself down on the grass and fell asleep.
When he woke, he saw that he had slept an hour and a
half. He hastily saddled his horse and rode on. The
horse seemed to have taken full advantage of Steve’s long
sleep, as he seemed quite refreshed again. Steve could
not but congratulate himself again and again as he saw
what great enduring powers the horse possessed.</p>

<p>At dusk our hero arrived at a wayside hotel. His
horse was now thoroughly tired. He saw that he
would have to stay here several hours, unless he
wanted his horse to give in. His first inquiry was for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
forage, which luckily was to be had in any quantity at a
big price.</p>

<p>After having seen his horse well fed and rubbed down,
Steve went into the house and asked for some supper.
Some cold meat, bread, butter and coffee was placed
before him, and he made as good a meal of it as could
be expected.</p>

<p>After supper, he asked for a room to lie down for a few
hours. He was shown a room not very clean and neat;
still a tired man could at least rest in it; besides, beggars
could not be choosers.</p>

<p>But before lying down, Steve went out to once more
see his horse supplied with forage. As he was superintending
the cutting up of the oat sheaves, the proprietor&mdash;whom
he had not yet seen&mdash;came up to him.
After a few introductory remarks between them, his host
asked him in English where he was going.</p>

<p>He replied in the same language, with as pure an
accent as the Englishman’s own, that he was going to
Krugersdorp.</p>

<p>‘Have you heard the glorious news?’ asked the host.</p>

<p>‘No; what is it?’</p>

<p>‘The Boers and Jameson have met, and Jameson has
defeated the Boers, killing three hundred of them.’</p>

<p>Steve turned pale in the dark. He could hardly speak
at first. At last he managed to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘How do you know this?’</p>

<p>‘I have just come back from our post-office, where I
had been to get some news. I there met a man who
had left the battlefield at noon; it was near Krugersdorp;
he had been riding post-haste to carry despatches somewhere.
He says it was an awful sight to see it. Jameson’s
troops were simply mowing the Boers down with Maxims
and Nordenfelds. The Boers had no Maxims or field-pieces,
and could simply do nothing with their rifles
against the troopers.’</p>

<p>‘But who is this despatch rider? Can his story be
believed?’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, as to that, there can be no doubt of it, he is
one of Jameson’s own officers; his name is Captain
Thatcher, so it must be true. It is a glorious day for
Englishmen. Amajuba has been wiped out at last,
and the English flag shall now once more fly over the
Transvaal.’ He thought he was speaking to an Englishman.
Steve answered not a word. He walked away.
He felt he could not restrain himself much longer in
this man’s presence. He walked blindly away towards
the open veld. It was moonlight, but he saw nothing
about him. He could only see in his mind’s eye, on
an open plain, a battlefield, and on this battlefield he
could see hundreds of his beloved countrymen lying&mdash;dead&mdash;murdered&mdash;by
the freebooters. Oh, what a
fearful sight. What homes are rendered desolate to-night
in this country? Can it be true? Alas, I am
afraid it is only too true. Jameson’s troops are well
prepared and armed. Those terrible Maxims <i>mowed</i>
down thousands of Matabeles in the same way, and
our poor Burghers were unprepared. There was no
time for them to wait for cannon and Maxims to come
up; they had to try and stop Jameson’s advance as
best they could, before he entered Johannesburg; and,
unprepared as they were, they fell into the terrible
death-trap laid for them.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my God, why hast Thou permitted this? What
hast Thy people done that Thou should desert them
now in their hour of need? Oh, God of Mercy, have
mercy on Thy people. Jesus, it can surely not be
Thy will that these murdering, grasping, gold-worshipping,
godless freebooters should slay Thy people in
this way. Oh, Father in Heaven, it is surely Thy will&mdash;nay,
it <i>is</i> Thy will, that we should become a people,
a nation, <span class="smcap">Free</span> and <span class="smcap">United</span>. God, Thou hast shown
it in the past; Thou hast led them on step by step,
day by day, year by year, and Thou hast always given
them glorious victory in their greatest time of peril.
Thou hast ever been their salvation; wilt Thou desert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
them now? Nay, Thou art not a God who does
anything by half; Thou wilt not leave Thy work incomplete.
Oh, God of Battles, show Thine wondrous
power once more, and save Thy people yet.’</p>

<p>With what earnestness did Steve pray. He prayed
and wrestled with God as he had never prayed or
wrestled before. When he left his landlord he was
faint with grief; great sobs of woe welled up from his
very heart; but now his faith in God once more
brought comfort and hope. He believed that God
would not desert his people.</p>

<p>He went to a stream which he heard rippling near
by, pulled off his clothes and had a moonlight bath,
after which he felt so much refreshed that he thought
he could sleep now. Going to his room, he once more
uttered a prayer for help and guidance, and fell peacefully
asleep, trusting all to his God.</p>

<p>He was awake at earliest daybreak, and, after rousing
his landlord to pay his bill, he resumed his journey.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAP_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="medium">THE BATTLE OF DOORNKOP</span></h2>

<p>Steve’s horse went bravely on, but with slackened
speed. We will not follow his further journey too
closely; he met many people, all telling different tales
as to the fortunes of war. One confirmed Captain
Thatcher’s tale, while others totally denied it.</p>

<p>Steve now found himself in the vicinity of Krugersdorp.
It was Thursday, the third day since he had
left his friends on the banks of the Vaal. He had
travelled about one hundred and fifty miles or more
during the forty-eight hours since he had left them.</p>

<p>He was riding along as fast as his horse would go;
for he knew he was reaching his journey’s end, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
could restrain his impatience no longer. He saw a
man galloping towards him in a slanting direction,
which would take him towards Krugersdorp. As the
man approached near enough, he recognised him to be
a newspaper reporter whom he had known in Pretoria.</p>

<p>He stopped the reporter and inquired eagerly for
news.</p>

<p>‘Oh! the Burghers are holding their own bravely.
Since yesterday they have kept Jameson dancing about,
trying to force his way through to Johannesburg, but in
vain; Jameson can’t get any nearer Johannesburg. The
Burghers are gradually enclosing him, and soon they will
have him and his freebooters at their mercy.’</p>

<p>‘Thank God! but how many Burghers have been
killed?’</p>

<p>‘Up to now, two or three at the most, and as many
wounded, while Jameson has lost heavily all along.’</p>

<p>‘What? You are fooling me!’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Last night I heard a report, spread by one Captain
Thatcher, a despatch rider of Jameson’s, that three
hundred Boers were killed, and that Jameson had beaten
the Boers.’</p>

<p>‘It is a d&mdash;&mdash;d lie!’ was the impolite but emphatic
denial. ‘You can take my word for it that not more
than two or three Boers are killed, and one was killed by
accident in the dark by his own people, while the Boers
have never been beaten yet by Jameson; on the contrary,
the Boers have held Jameson in check all along,
and have only been waiting for reinforcements and their
artillery to carry Jameson and his troopers by storm.’</p>

<p>The reporter here stopped, and sat looking at Steve
open-mouthed. The antics of this young man were really
amusing, to say the least of it. He had rolled off his
horse, and was now lying on his back, kicking his feet in
the air, and now he was capering about on the grass,
throwing summersault upon summersault, all the while
shouting and laughing like one possessed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>‘I say, Joubert, stop that; are you mad? Get on
your horse and go on; I have no time to look after a
lunatic now, or to take you to the lunatic asylum.’</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, old man; I had to do it, or I
should really have gone mad from joy, but I am better
now,’ said Steve, remounting his horse. ‘Where are you
going to?’ he asked of the reporter.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I am off to town to send news to the <i>Pretoria
Press</i>, which I represent here. And what do you intend
doing?’</p>

<p>‘I wish to join one of our commandos; where shall I
find one?’</p>

<p>‘If you will go to the top of that rise there, you will
see the whole position. When I came over it, the
Burghers were retreating from the railway cutting (which
they had occupied during the night) towards that very
ridge. I think they intend taking possession of it and
the drift, so as to finally stop the progress of the Chartered
troops. Good-bye; I must be off to send particulars of
our position to our paper. Take care of yourself and
keep out of the way of the Maxims.’</p>

<p>What gratitude filled the heart of Steve now when he
knew that Captain Thatcher’s story was all lies and
invention.</p>

<p>It went beyond Steve’s comprehension what object
any man could have in telling such deliberate lies. This
Captain Thatcher ought to have known that what he was
saying was all lies, and that ultimately his want of
veracity was bound to be discovered. Steve could find
only one explanation, and that was that such a person
tells lies simply for the love of the thing, and for the
temporary notoriety that such sensational tales may
bring. Some people have a way of manufacturing their
news according to the demand of their audiences. If
the audience were composed of Government haters and
Jameson sympathisers the news was made to suit their
wishes, while if it were friends of the Government, the
contrary rule was observed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>When Steve came to the top of the height he saw a
party of Burghers coming directly towards him. At a
distance he perceived a large troop of men coming in
apparent pursuit of the Burghers. These latter he correctly
took to be Jameson’s filibusters.</p>

<p>‘Thank God! I have arrived in time to fight with my
countrymen for life or&mdash;death. And if it is to lose, I
would a thousand times rather die than live!’ thought
Steve to himself.</p>

<p>Where he was standing on the rise or ridge, a reef was
cropping out, throwing out projections of rocks, which
formed splendid natural fortifications, giving good protection
against the fire of an enemy coming in the
direction from which Jameson was coming.</p>

<p>The Burghers seemed to be retiring from the enemy&mdash;<i>so
were</i> they. The fire from Jameson’s Maxims and long-range
field-pieces could not be resisted on the open veld,
for which reason they were retiring towards the aforesaid
out-croppings, where Steve was standing. When they
arrived on the spot, Steve discovered the field cornet in
command of the Burghers to be an old acquaintance and
friend of his. It did not take Steve more than a minute
to explain matters, and to be provided with a spare rifle
and a belt of ammunition.</p>

<p>The Burghers now took up their position amongst the
rocks (which were situated exactly on the sky line of the
ridge mostly, thus giving them the command of the
approaches to the drift through which Jameson must
pass if he passed the Burghers at all) and prepared to
oppose the passage of the enemy. Jameson came on
now&mdash;Maxims, field-pieces and all; his force was variously
estimated from five hundred to eight hundred men.
His troops were forcing onwards towards the drift.</p>

<p>Opposing his passage to the drift were eighty-seven
Burghers (this is correct, as near as possible; there may
have been a difference of one or two, more or less&mdash;but
rather less) disposed in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first patch of rocks, two hundred yards from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
the road, twenty-five men occupied a position; farther
on fifteen men were disposed a little nearer to the drift,
but in a line with the aforesaid twenty-five men; still
nearer to the drift seven men were lying in wait. Beyond
the drift, about seven hundred yards away, forty
Burghers occupied a small kopje. These forty men
could only fire at long range on the enemy, as the
long range field-pieces of the enemy prevented their
leaving their shelter. The seven and fifteen men mentioned
had to do most of the fighting, and had to stand
the hottest fire, as the Maxims were playing almost
continually on their position, but they were nobly supported
by the twenty-five men stationed a little higher
up. Jameson’s passage to the drift was soon stopped
by the heavy fire of the Burghers, his men were dropping
continually. He was obliged to give up all idea
of crossing, and took possession of a farmhouse, a cattle
kraal and stone-walled land. His Maxims and field-pieces
were protected partially by the stone wall of the
land. The majority of troops took possession of the
kraal and the house. The men in possession of the
kraal and house found themselves directly opposed to the
twenty-five men on the ridge. The Maxims directed
their fire mostly on the parties of fifteen and seven, who
were directly opposite them. The field-pieces directed
the full force of their fire on the forty Burghers occupying
the kopje beyond the drift, who were seven hundred yards
away, while the party of twenty-five was about two hundred
yards from the kraal and house occupied by the
enemy, and the parties of fifteen and seven, who were
near to each other, were about one hundred yards from
the troopers, and four hundred yards from the Maxims.
More Burghers, amounting to over one thousand, were
certainly in the neighbourhood of the battlefield, but
were too far away to take part in the fight, and those
occupying the positions above described were the only
Burghers fighting&mdash;actually fighting, I mean&mdash;against
Jameson at the battle of Doornkop. Steve found himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
amongst the party of fifteen described as being
opposed to the Maxims.</p>

<p>It was a terrible ordeal for those twenty-two men
lying flat behind the rocks. The Maxim bullets literally
rained on them, and, unprotected by the rocks, every
soul of that little band would have been wiped out in a
few moments.</p>

<p>Steve heard (in fact, felt) a continuous patter against
the rock in front of him. It seemed to him as if a whole
battery of Maxims were firing at that particular rock.
The chips of rock and sand were raining upon him,
thrown up by the bullets. Luckily his rock was just
large enough to protect him against the heavy and
continuous fire. Once he just peeped over a little dent
in the rock, took aim and fired, when <i>whew</i> came a
bullet right through his hat. Next moment his body
must have moved slightly outside the line protected by
the rock, when he felt a stinging sensation at his hip,
a bullet had just grazed him. He got several more
through his clothing in this way, as he moved and
wormed himself about to take aim to fire. Luckily the
Maxims could not fire all over at once, and while they
fired at one party the other party would take advantage
of the diversion in their favour to rain well-aimed shots
on the enemy, and when a Burgher fired he reckoned
upon one enemy being the less, either wounded or killed.
For a Transvaal Boer never wastes ammunition; he
never fires unless he is sure of his aim. A pang of pity
went through Steve’s heart as he saw the poor troopers
of Jameson dropping down one after the other; he felt
that, although they were guilty of a great wrong to
his country, still they were human, and to be hurled
into eternity while participating in such a cowardly,
back-handed blow against a people who had looked
upon them as friends, and not as foes, was awful.
And while aiming his rifle as accurately as he could,
he murmured a prayer for the souls of those that he
was helping to send to the judgment seat of God, but&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
self-defence, in defence of country and national
existence.</p>

<p>When first the fight began, Steve had felt the trembling,
half fear, half suspense and excitement, usually experienced
by the soldier on first facing the fire of battle.
But soon he felt as calm and cool as if he were taking
part in a target practice.</p>

<p>‘By Heaven, but these English can fight better than I
thought,’ remarked a Burgher on the left of Steve. ‘I
have never known them to fight so bravely before; I
will give them credit for that.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, they do fight bravely,’ replied an old man next
to him. ‘I never saw a brave fight such as this in 1881;
but you must remember they have had their training in
South Africa.’</p>

<p>‘True,’ was the reply.</p>

<p>At this moment Steve heard a groan on his right.
Turning round, he saw a young fellow lying in such a
position, that he perceived at once he must be wounded.
He rolled himself towards the wounded man, took his
head upon his knees and spoke to him, but received no
answer. On examination he saw that he had been shot
through the head. It was poor M’Donald, who, although
shot through the brain, lived ten days longer, and then
died, when he received an honoured funeral.</p>

<p>Steve helped to carry the wounded man down the
opposite side of the ridge into safety, where he was left
with one more wounded Burgher, in a small deserted
house, in the care of two men. Steve then returned to
his place, and resumed his share in the fierce fight.</p>

<p>The battle was raging fierce and hot. The cannon of
the Chartered troops roared hoarsely above the rattle
of small arms; while the continuous rat-a-tat-tat-tat of
the Maxims was also to be distinguished from the more
irregular and less incessant cracking of the rifles. A
heavy cloud of smoke was floating above, concealing the
sun as if it wished to hide the murderous work from the
sight of Heaven. The slaughter amongst the Chartered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
troops was terrible. One detachment after another
bravely charged the position of the Burghers, under
the protection of their Maxims; but it was in vain, the
heavy and accurate fire of the Burghers forced them to
retire with great loss every time; and the Chartered
troopers were only too glad to regain their shelter.</p>

<p>In spite of his pity for them, Steve’s heart throbbed
with a joy almost savage in its intensity when he saw
the troopers giving way all along the line. They seemed
to look for some point of safety towards which they
might fly. But ’tis a vain hope. Look towards whatever
side they will, they could see Burghers in the distance
awaiting them. <i>They were thoroughly hemmed in.</i></p>

<p>Steve saw all this and realised the position in which
Jameson must find himself. He tried to place himself
in Jameson’s position in imagination.</p>

<p>‘What should I do if I were to find myself in such a
hole of my own making? Should I surrender and take
my chance of getting out alive? Could I expect to get
out alive in case I surrendered? No! A filibustering
murderer can expect nothing but death. Death would
be my sentence, by <i>Human Laws</i>, by <i>Moral Law</i>, by
God’s Law. I could not even expect a word of mercy
from England. She has disowned me and my expedition,
and I have disobeyed her. <i>No</i>, rather than give in
now, after having ventured so much and risked so much
to obtain my aim (whatever that may be), I would rather
fight to the end and obtain that sympathy and that
martyrdom that the grave always brings. That would be
something, at least, while to surrender <i>now</i> would mean
eternal disgrace, trouble unending, and perhaps death on
the scaffold.</p>

<p>But Jameson must have thought otherwise, as we shall
see. He was either too cowardly to die such a death, or
he must have known beforehand that external aid (of
which Steve did not know then) would be rendered him.
He must have known (maybe it was promised him in
case of failure) that the full weight of Chartered influences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
and Chartered capital would be exerted in his
favour.</p>

<p>While Steve was thus meditating, as he surveyed the
field of battle and Jameson’s hopeless condition, the
battle was still proceeding as fiercely as ever. Turn and
twist as they would, the Chartered troops found that the
Boer bullets followed them everywhere.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cheer was raised by the Burghers. Steve
looked to see the reason for this, and saw, directed by
the joyful looks of the Burghers, the State artillery taking
up a position on a distant rise.</p>

<p>The artillery had arrived at last, but too late. At
this moment a white flag was hoisted by the Chartered
troops. It had been asserted by some that the
Burghers fired a volley after the white flag was hoisted.
It is partly true. The flag was hoisted by the troopers
directly facing Steve’s party of Burghers. The white
flag was out of sight of the twenty-five Burghers stationed
higher up, as the rocks hid the lower end of Jameson’s
line from their view. Therefore a few shots were fired
by them the moment after the flag was hoisted. But the
shouts of their companions who saw the flag apprised
them of the fact, when, of course, they immediately ceased
firing.</p>

<p>The Burghers now left their shelter and came out,
walking and riding towards Jameson’s position. Jameson’s
troopers deployed, so as to place themselves between
the Burghers and their own Maxims and
cannon.</p>

<p>The field cornet now ordered a Burgher named P.
Nagel to go and see ‘what the English wanted.’ He
went, and returned with a request from Jameson to be
allowed to return over the border. He (Jameson) was
informed that his request was impossible, as he had had
the opportunity given him to return before any fighting
took place, and he failed to take advantage of it, but that
a meeting of officers would be called together at once to
further consider his request.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile Commandant Cronje, who was with
the Burghers beyond the drift, sent to Jameson to know
whether he surrendered, being unaware of the messenger
sent by the field cornet, and whose report had been submitted
to Commandant Polgieter of Krugersdorp. Jameson
replied to Commandant Cronje’s message with an
offer to surrender if the lives of himself and men were
guaranteed, whereupon Commandant Cronje informed
Jameson that if he laid down his arms and would promise
to pay the expenses of the Government of the South
African Republic, that he would guarantee the lives of
himself and men <i>until handed over to the Commandant-General,
when the Krijgsraad would further decide upon
his case</i>. More, he had no authority to promise. He
gave Jameson thirty minutes to consider and accept.
<i>Jameson accepted.</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAP_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="medium">PROBABLE DANGERS AVERTED BY DOORNKOP’S FIGHT</span></h2>

<p>A short time later, Commandant Malan arriving on
the scene, inquired as to what the terms of surrender
were. After being informed as to the promise given
Jameson to safely deliver him into the hands of the
Commandant-General, he made a member of the Burgher
party, who spoke English well, to distinctly make Jameson
understand that the lives of himself and men were
guaranteed only while on the field of battle and while on
their passage to Pretoria, when the proper authorities
would further decide as to their ultimate fate.</p>

<p>Of course these conditions could hardly be called conditions,
except the conditions extracted from Jameson,
that they would lay down their arms and pay all expenses;
and even that followed as a natural result on defeat.
While the promise given by the commandant, that his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
life would be safe-guarded while in transit to Pretoria
was also but a natural result of civilised warfare (if fighting
a filibustering murdering foe could be called civilised
warfare), and would have followed in any case, promise
or no promise. But the promise was given, as Jameson
and his officers seemed to fear the anger of the justly
incensed Burghers.</p>

<p>When the white flag was hoisted by the Chartered
troopers, the Burghers were distrustful. They reasoned
thus: ‘These people are not to be trusted. They came
into our country in a treacherous manner. They slunk
in when they thought we were off our guard. Now,
having acted once in a treacherous manner, are they
not capable of acting so again? Is it not their object to
draw us out of our position and shelter, and then to cut
us down with their Maxims and cannon? No, before we
expose ourselves, we must be assured of their honest
surrender; and someone must first go and see what they
want. Who will go?’ Without a moment’s hesitation
Steve jumped on the nearest horse, and rode full speed
towards the Chartered troopers. On looking round, he
saw he was followed by half-a-dozen more young fellows
of the Burgher force. So he was one of the first to speak
to the invaders after the white flag was hoisted.</p>

<p>Another incident, tragic in its result, took place after
the surrender of the Chartered arms. A young, inexperienced
Burgher was curiously handling and examining
one of the magazine rifles, forming part of the spoils of
war, when, somehow or other, the <i>thing</i> went off, and
wounded a fellow-Burgher, standing in front of him.
The poor fellow died from the wound.</p>

<p>That careless young man got the severest reprimand
from his commandant that ever he had in his life before;
but being able to satisfactorily prove that it was an accident,
he was not punished. But he seemed sufficiently
punished by the thought that he had caused the death of
a companion. He seemed to take the disgrace, and the
death of the victim much to heart, and hardly spoke for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
days after. He wept when he left the commandant’s
tent.</p>

<p>Jameson’s men received the best attention possible,
even on the field of battle. Those who had provisions
shared with them; and afterwards they were taken to
Krugersdorp, where they were treated more like guests
than prisoners. Of course any attempt at escape was
guarded against.</p>

<p>Jameson and officers were forwarded to Pretoria without
unnecessary delay. Jameson seemed especially sad and
broken-hearted. Who knows what hopes were dashed to
the ground? Who knows his thoughts when he entered
the territory of a State at peace with his own country, into
which he was carrying the torch of civil war, murder and
famine? It was like taking a lighted torch into a powder
magazine. He knew that his advent meant ‘war to the
knife’&mdash;to the bitter end; and the more success he had
at first, the more disastrous must the end be. Had he
reached Johannesburg, who could foresee where the
bloodshed would have ended? And the thousands of
innocent, peaceable citizens of Johannesburg must have
suffered, and did suffer, with the guilty. All to satisfy
the love of power, glory, and lust of gold of a few unscrupulous
men. But be assured, O reader, that, if man
does not punish them, a higher power <i>will</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever Jameson’s reward for success was to have
been, president (?), governor (?), administrator (?), or prime
minister to the modern Emperor Napoleon, I do not
know. This I do know, he seemed to recognise that all
was lost, that all the grand dreams of power and gold
dreamt by him and his fellow-conspirators had vanished
into mist; for he never spoke a word but&mdash;wept. Would
that he had wept tears of repentance at the bloodshed,
the distress and heartburnings he had caused, instead of
weeping for failure. Or would that he had wept tears of
joy that he had failed to set the Powers of the world
fighting a terrible war; a war such as Napoleon even never
saw. A war that would have changed the destinies of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
many a nation on earth. A war that would have changed
the map of the world, to what extent no one can say.
<i>What an escape.</i></p>

<p>Small things have world-wide effects. The battle of
Doornkop saved the world many a battle. Why?
Because if Jameson had not been defeated, and had not
surrendered, and had reached Johannesburg, Johannesburg
would have taken courage. The strong would have
been stronger, the wavering would have wavered no more,
even the peacefully inclined would have been peaceful no
more. The rebellion would have been an accomplished
fact. The proclamation, proclaiming the provisional
government, instead of being secretly destroyed, and put
out of type, would have been proclaimed. Civil war would
have raged. England would have stepped in and interfered.
And although the South African Republic did
<small>NOT</small> ask for European aid, Europe <i>would have</i> interfered.
France, Germany, Russia and (believe it if you
will or not)&mdash;the sister Republic&mdash;the United States. The
chance would have been too good for these powers to
lose the opportunity to give effect to their growing
jealousy of the increasing colonial wealth and power of
England. The whispered coalition between France,
Germany and Russia (which only died out because
<i>the fuel on which it was fed gave up</i>, viz., the fear or
hope that England would take up the part of the rebels
and go against the Boer Government) would have been
proclaimed and given effect to. What would have been
the result? We can only surmise.</p>

<p>However, one of two things would have happened.
England would have been raised to a higher pinnacle of
power than she ever occupied before; or&mdash;the breaking
up of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Well, analyse England’s position.</p>

<p>England was <i>gloriously isolated</i>, as a certain Canadian
politician termed it.</p>

<p>Germany was against her.</p>

<p>Germany of course meant <i>the</i> Triple Alliance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>France and Russia could not be depended upon.</p>

<p>The United States of America had set her foot down
against English pretensions in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Europe was against England! Turkey? No need to
say anything about Turkey? Everybody knows the
situation there at the time America was against England.
Upon whom could England reckon in her time of need?
Her colonies? Her colonies will need to be protected
by her, instead of rendering any aid! Herself? Could
Great Britain and Ireland reckon upon <small>HERSELF</small>? How
about Ireland? Has England any right to depend upon
Irish aid in time of need? The contrary rather! No,
Great Britain could reckon upon Great Britain, but not
upon Great Britain <i>and Ireland</i>; nor Greater Britain
either!</p>

<p>And as to South Africa (remember we are considering
the extreme case). England thus situated could not
bring much force to bear upon South Africa. And how
would South Africa stand in such a case? Of course, with
such a provocation, the Transvaal and Free State would
stand together, that is taken for granted without argument&mdash;that
has been proved. But what about the Cape
Colony? Nine tenths of the population of the Cape
Colony and Natal are Afrikanders. Those Afrikanders
would have seen that <small>THEIR TIME HAD ARRIVED</small>. No
more need be said, except that a united South Africa
would have been realized at last, <i>and a Republican united
South Africa</i>. Of course, there are those who will call
this reasoning <i>all moonshine</i>. There are those who call
England’s isolation <i>glorious</i>. There are those who consider
England capable of fighting the united world, and
still being victorious. Well, let them think so. Let them
put their head in the sand, like the ostrich, and refuse to
read the signs of the times. It is good for <i>such</i> British
subjects that they are not at the head of the British
Government. It is fortunate for the British Empire that
they have men in their ministry like Chamberlain. <i>He</i>
saw the breakers ahead; and like a good steersman, kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
clear of the rocks. <i>He</i> saw that it was better to make
friends of a quiet, peace-loving nation rather than foes.
It is true he has made a mistake now and then; but he
is only human, and almost unhuman like, he acknowledged
his mistakes, more credit to him. Let him continue
to maintain peace, by being just and fair, and he
may reckon upon making friends, instead of foes, of the
great Afrikander nation that is being built up in South
Africa.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAP_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="medium">THE FIGHTING PREVIOUS TO DOORNKOP’S BATTLE</span></h2>

<p>Steve inquired from his friend the field cornet for
particulars of the fight previous to his arrival. We give
the words of the field cornet <i>verbatim</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Fighting began yesterday. We were only a small
party of Burghers at first, and could hardly expect to
defeat Jameson on the open veld, so we harassed him
as much as possible, to delay him until reinforcements
arrived. But we had to remain at a distance most of the
time, as we had only rifles to fight with, and they had
Maxims, which carried much farther than our Martinis,
not to speak of their field-pieces. But later on in the
day we reached a strong position. We were directly in
Jameson’s road. He had to conquer us before he could
pass on towards Johannesburg <i>via</i> Krugersdorp. But
we were quite confident that our position was inaccessible
to the enemy. We had selected a <i>rise</i>, crested with
rocks, offering good shelter against the enemy’s fire.
Below the rise, and between us and the enemy, was a
spruit, spreading out into a marsh. Through this marshy
spruit the enemy had to pass before reaching our position.
Beyond the marsh the enemy took up a position with
their cannon and Maxims, sending out three detachments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
to charge us. One party of about eighty troopers
charged our centre, through the usual drift of the spruit,
while the other two detachments charged our left and
right wings respectively. At this moment our ammunition
was giving in. We had anxiously been awaiting an
ammunition train, which we had been informed had
been despatched from Pretoria for our use. Half-an-hour
before the enemy prepared to charge, a messenger
had arrived from Krugersdorp to inform us of the arrival
of the ammunition train there, with a promise that a
trolley loaded with the required ammunition would soon
follow. Now, just at the moment when the enemy were
leaving their own position to charge us, and when we
most needed it, the much-longed-for ammunition trolley
arrived upon the scene. An old man, with several others,
was standing on the trolley handing packets of cartridges
down, when a shell from the enemy fell right on top of
the ammunition trolley between the group handing the
cartridges down, and burst. Marvellous to relate, the
shell did no injury to the ammunition, nor was anyone
hurt.</p>

<p>‘“A miracle! a miracle, brothers!” cried the old man.
“God is with us, let us fight and conquer; God has
given them into our hands.” The face of the old
patriarch glowed with faith as he spoke.</p>

<p>‘This seemed to give us all fresh courage and enthusiasm,
and as the enemy came charging in their three
divisions we repelled them with great loss to themselves.
The right and left divisions of the enemy were simply
forced to retire in disorder, leaving several of their comrades
on the veld. The centre detachment of the enemy
succeeded in reaching the drift of the spruit, but the
Burgher fire was too hot for them; a part of them fled
back and succeeded in rejoining their main force, but
seven of them were left wounded on the road, and, as
we afterwards ascertained, nineteen of them took cover
amongst the tall grass of the marsh, and lay in the mud
and water until their main force retired from the scene
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
towards evening, when we took the above-mentioned nineteen
troopers prisoners. Poor fellows, they were in a
sorry plight; they had been lying under water and mud
all the time, with only their noses and mouths out of water
for breathing.</p>

<p>‘As I said, the main force saw that they could not
force our position, and retired, cutting across the veld
with the hope of avoiding us; but while the majority of
us remained to guard the road at the drift, about one
hundred of us kept abreast of Jameson’s force, so as to
prevent them from slipping through.</p>

<p>‘We saw Jameson was heading towards the railway
cutting, so we raced on ahead and took possession of
the cutting, using the embankment as a breastwork, and
again brought the invaders to a full stop. As it was getting
dark now, Jameson encamped for the night, out
of rifle shot from the embankment; but he was near
enough to keep on shelling our position, off and on,
during the night. But as we were well protected by
our embankment, no harm was done.</p>

<p>‘During the night, a sad accident happened.</p>

<p>‘The son of Commandant Cronje, who was rather too
venturesome, had crossed the railway cutting and was
riding about on the other side. We could not recognise
him in the dark. We thought it was a spy from the
enemy. We called out three times, “Who goes there?”
but received no reply. Whether he did not hear us, I
cannot say; some of our men fired and he fell, severely
wounded. It is a sad thing that, out of five of our
Burghers who have been killed, two have been killed by
our own men, besides the one wounded just now by that
careless young man. And another, I hear, has been
killed to-day by our own men. He was near to the
enemy, and as his dress was somewhat similar to Jameson’s
troopers, he was fired at and killed; and our men
only found out their mistake when too late.</p>

<p>‘Well, to resume, when day broke, Jameson once more
earnestly set to work, trying to beat us back from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
embankment, but in vain. We drove him along the
line, always keeping him back and preventing him from
crossing. But while he kept us busy, he sent some of
his heavy field-pieces on ahead, which crossed over before
we saw their dodge, as we were busy repelling charge
after charge from Jameson’s troopers. As he was able
to sweep our side of the embankment now, we had to
leave Jameson in possession of the line. We now resolved
once more to retire, and go on ahead to cut
Jameson off at some other convenient place. Jameson
was now on the road to Doornkop, and in possession of
the road. It was vain for us to attempt stopping him on
the open road, as he had the advantage of numbers, as
well as having cannon and Maxims against our rifles.
We resolved to cut across the veld towards the drift at
Brinks’ farm, which Jameson must cross to reach Krugersdorp,
unless he took the other road, on which our commando
was waiting for him. We raced across the veld
and arrived here, finding you in possession already. The
rest you know yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but you say one hundred of you left the main
commando to watch Jameson as he was dodging about;
what has become of those hundred men? There are only
eighty-seven here on the battlefield, besides those who
came after the battle was over. What has become of
the rest?’</p>

<p>‘Well, you see, as we raced across the veld to cut
Jameson off here, those who had the weakest horses
were left behind, and they, in their turn, were again cut
off by Jameson’s men, and they had to go a roundabout
way to reach us. I see they have arrived now, but too
late to take part in the fight.’</p>

<p>Steve thanked his friend for the information, and resumed
his investigations elsewhere.</p>

<p>Steve was detailed to assist in guarding the prisoners,
and as he spoke English well, he questioned them and
got much information from them.</p>

<p>One of them told him that he had been lying in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
slight depression of the ground during the fight. He
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I thought that, if I lay flat, the Boers could never
hit me, as a slight hollow seemed to afford me all the
protection I needed. But the bullets kept striking right
in front of my eyes, and the ground seemed to be wearing
down more and more in front of me, so that the
bullets, instead of passing over me, threatened to soon
pass through me. I had a hatchet, which I used to
deepen my little hollow as fast as my protection was being
shot away. Thus, by hugging the ground closely, I
managed to escape safe and sound to the end.’</p>

<p>Many of them told tales of marvellous escapes from
the unerring aim of the Burghers, as well as unheard-of
hiding-places used by them during the battle.</p>

<p>They told of how they had to leave dead and wounded,
the day before; Jameson seeming to think that the dead
might bury its own dead!&mdash;he only cared for the living.</p>

<p>I may here state that the Government sent parties on
the route travelled to bury the dead and succour the deserted
wounded. Some of these last had undergone
terrible sufferings&mdash;wounded, unprotected, unsheltered,
deserted by their friends, they lay on the veld; but Jameson
has enough to answer for already&mdash;over this we shall
draw a veil and say no more.</p>

<p>Another told how he was one of several who had been
sent from Johannesburg to join Jameson beyond the
border. They had been engaged to fight Kaffirs. When
they were told that they were going to march to Johannesburg,
many deserted. These latter were Afrikanders of the
right sort, and declined to fight their own countrymen.</p>

<p>‘Even I would have deserted if I had had the
chance, but I was too closely watched,’ remarked his
informant.</p>

<p>‘But could these Afrikanders, who meant the Transvaal
well, not send a telegram to warn the Government
of their danger and of Jameson’s intentions?’</p>

<p>‘No; why we could not even write a letter to our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
relatives unless it was submitted to the officers to first
read it.’</p>

<p>‘When did you first learn your true destination?’</p>

<p>‘When Jameson and other officers addressed us, and
told us that we were going to assist men, women and
children at the Rand, who were in danger of their lives.
He told us that we were going to assist in upholding
British supremacy in South Africa, and that he was sure
not a shot would be fired; also, that the Boers would not
be molested.</p>

<p>‘He asked for volunteers, but no one moved until
ordered to do so. Great promises were made to us. We
were promised £1000 and a farm each if successful,
besides other considerations. I am afraid we have lost
that farm and £1000,’ he concluded smilingly.</p>

<p>Another one informed Steve how Jameson had been
preparing for months back for his raid into the Transvaal.</p>

<p>‘We were not supposed to know what the great preparations
were made for; it was stated by our leaders
that we were going to fight some native chief, but many
of us had our suspicions. There was too much mystery
and private conference amongst the officers. I for one
had my suspicions, and it has exactly turned out as I
expected. I am only surprised that your Government
did not suspect what was going on. Why, all along our
route we found buildings erected, containing stores, forage
and food for ourselves, and even fresh horses. All this
must have taken time to prepare. Always in due time
we found one of these stores, containing food and forage.’</p>

<p>‘But how is it that I hear your leader wrote, in reply
to the protest of the Commandant of Marico against his
entry into the country, that he came in reply to a request
for help from leading men in Johannesburg to protect
life and property, and to help them to obtain certain
political rights, for which they had asked a week
ago. He also gave you and others to understand that
he was going to Johannesburg to protect women and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
children against goodness knows what. Now the only
danger that Johannesburg and its inhabitants may be in
might be because they have been in a revolutionary state
for the last few days. How could Jameson have known
months ago that this would be the case, if he has been
preparing himself for months?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you must be innocent! Do you believe, or do you
think we ever believed this story about protecting women
and children. Look here! I am a man of the world,
and I know when two and two make four. I have kept
my eyes and ears open, and I have found out a thing
or two, and you may believe me when I say that the
whole thing is a deep laid plot to dispossess your Government
of all responsibility of the government of the Transvaal.
You must know that Johannesburg is altogether
too rich to be left in the possession of the Boers, and
certain wealthy and avaricious persons in England, Cape
Town and Johannesburg have formed a great plot to get
possession of your country. You may thank your stars
that you have defeated us; if you had allowed us to
once enter Johannesburg, I think Paul Kruger and his
people would have been lost, and instead of Paul Kruger,
Cecil Rhodes would have been your chief, and I pity
your people if Cecil Rhodes had them in his power; he
would rule them with a rod of iron.’</p>

<p>‘Thank God, Cecil Rhodes is not all-powerful,’ said
Steve; ‘even the power of a millionaire and diamond
king is limited, and I hope that after this, the eyes of the
Colonial Afrikander Bond will be opened, and that his
power will be more limited still?’</p>

<p>‘Do your people then know that he is at the head of
all this plot and revolution?’</p>

<p>‘We do not know yet positively, but we suspect a
great deal, and will know all soon, I expect.’</p>

<p>Steve was very tired that evening, but he saw that
many Burghers had had a very hard struggle to arrive in
time, and that most of them had slept even less than he
had done the last few days, and not one of them complained,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
or tried to shirk duty, therefore he volunteered
for guard duty or anything else that he might be required
for. He was then appointed to be one of the guards
escorting the officers to Pretoria.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAP_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="medium">JOHANNESBURG DURING THE CRISIS</span></h2>

<p>Let us take a look at what Johannesburg and Pretoria
has been doing during the time Steve had been away
from home.</p>

<p>Ever since the publication of the famous National
Union Manifesto, Johannesburg had been in a state of
turmoil and excitement. At first everything was said in
whispers, and all revolutionary acts and preparations
were done in stealth; only the Press belonging to the
anti-Boer organisation kept up its usual vituperations of
the Government, in addition to revolutionary articles
well calculated to incite the population to a rebellious
state. There seemed to be some electric depression in
the atmosphere. Everybody seemed to distrust his
neighbour, especially the guilty plotters seemed to dread
detection. But soon speech and action became bolder,
as it was seen the Government was disinclined to take
any strong measures. The policy of the Government
seemed to have been one of gentleness and conciliation.
All the Government officials had received orders
to avoid giving offence, or to do aught to incite the
populace, or cause a disturbance of the peace; particular
stress was laid on the order to avoid making a
show of armed force, either of police or armed Burghers.</p>

<p>This was taken as a confession of weakness on the
part of the Government by the revolutionists, and it was
resolved to follow up the apparent advantage gained.
Open enlistment now went on. Every scamp, ex-prisoner,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
burglar or vagabond who was willing to take
up arms, was enlisted.</p>

<p>But now the weakness of the revolutionists became
apparent. When it came to fighting nobody wanted to
fight. The thousands of English miners upon whom
the capitalistic schemers had reckoned, failed them.
These miners were sensible men, and wise in their
generation. They argued in this way:</p>

<p>‘Why should we fight? We have nothing to fight for;
we have everything we can wish for; we are living in a
labourers’ paradise; we are as free as we have never
been in our own country; we are prosperous, and pay
only 18s. 6d. a year in taxes&mdash;that is when we choose
to do so. What do we care about the franchise, we are
in this country to make money, and we are making it
hand over fist. We did not come here to engage in
political strife, or to fight the battles of scheming
and plotting capitalists who would reward us when
once they are in power, by combining against us, and
bringing us down to the low level in which our brethren
in Europe and America have been brought by capitalists.
No, Messrs Cecil Rhodes, Phillips, Leonard, Farrar and
company will have to fight their own battles, <i>we</i> are not
going to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for them, and
then be kicked for our pains&mdash;<i>dead off</i>!’ Thus the
honest Cornishmen and other miners argued. But all
the same these miners were patriotic enough, or maybe
they did not feel interest in the subject enough to take
any active part in the strife at all; be the reason what it
may, they refused to take the part of either side, and
many of them left the country altogether for the time
being. We think, if any were required, this was argument
enough, that the real working men, <i>the people</i> (who
are generally the first to revolutionise, where revolution
is wanted), refused absolutely to have anything to do
with this so-called revolution. Not only did they refuse
to fight gratuitously, but when the option was given
them, either to take up arms or to clear, they chose the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
latter alternative. This, we say, was argument enough
to show that the revolution&mdash;so-called&mdash;was simply a
capitalistic plot, created with mercenary motives.</p>

<p>The leaders&mdash;self-elected&mdash;of the National Union had
assumed another name by this time; they now called
themselves the ‘Reform Committee’&mdash;a name which
was to become notorious indeed all the world over a
little later on. To gain as much influence as possible
both with the outside world as with the local populace,
they added to themselves the names of most of the leading
men of the Rand. Many of the latter, although
members of the Reform Committee, and advertised as
such, were innocent of any evil intentions. Some refused
absolutely to figure as members, while others consented
to their names being used when assured by the
original conspirators that nothing unconstitutional would
be done, and that they would only agitate for certain
concessions from the Government. These deluded persons
of course had to suffer for their weakness later on.</p>

<p>What to do now? The populace refuses to fight. The
Reform Committee resolved to carry on the revolution by
the means of GOLD. This is the golden city. We are
all gold kings, we will let our gold fight our battles, and
when everything is gained, we shall get our gold back a
thousandfold. Thus they argued, and the result was,
<i>one pound sterling a day</i> was offered to any and everybody
who would take up arms and fight against the Government.</p>

<p>It is true a few corps&mdash;small corps, too&mdash;were raised
without pay, but with the avowed object only to protect
life and property and not to fight against the Government.
It seems the conspirators had foreseen this apathy or want
of interest on the part of the populace in their artificial
revolution, for which reason they had arranged the
Jameson Raid. Whoever had first thought of this arrangement,
viz., Jameson’s Raid? Was it the Reform
Committee, or was it the arch conspirator himself?
Certain it is, it was a short-sighted policy, for Jameson’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
failure, as we shall see, ruined all their hopes. But
we are inclined towards the belief that, although the Reform
Committee sent the invitation to Jameson, it was
done by the suggestion of the arch conspirator himself&mdash;Rhodes.
Of course the chief conspirators on the Rand,
the originators of the so-called revolution, were nothing
but the agents of their chief in Cape Town, and all they
did and suggested (it must be taken for granted) emanated
from their leader. And we can understand his policy. If
he had left the whole conduct of the affair to the Johannesburg
Committee, they might take the bit in their
mouth, and strike out for themselves, and leave him out
in the cold, once success was assured. They might
disown him, and take all the fruits of success for themselves,
and possession being ten points of the law in such
a case, he would be nicely sold. To guard against this,
he must have decided to have a force of his own on the
spot at any cost, by which means he hoped to hold the
trump cards, in case his friends tried to play him false.
And his fears were not unfounded by any means, as the
majority of the conspirators who joined later, and especially
those who were not in all the secrets of the organisation,
were in favour of retaining the republican form of government
in the event of success. This was evidenced by the
fact that the Committee felt themselves compelled to
confess to only wishing for a reformed Republic, and
not for any other form of government. This was even
carried so far that (whether in good faith or not we
cannot say) the Transvaal flag was hoisted on the Gold
Fields Office, the headquarters of the Reform Committee.
This must have caused gnashing of teeth in the private
cabinet of a certain prime minister in the Cape Colony
when he received the news, and even his faithful agents
on the Rand must have felt terrified and troubled when
they saw the prize slipping through their fingers. What
account will they be able to give to their lord and master
of their stewardship in case of failure? One only hope
was left them&mdash;Jameson. If Jameson came they would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
work together harmoniously, and together subdue and
conquer the Boer, after which it would be time enough,
and opportunity enough, with the aid of Jameson and his
victorious troopers, to enforce <i>their</i> views and objects on
the people of the Rand.</p>

<p>The eyes of all the conspirators were now fixed on
Jameson.</p>

<p>It seems Jameson had started a little too ‘previous.’
Something had gone wrong. What that something was
has not as yet been revealed. However, Jameson’s premature
advance precipitated matters. Everything was
hurried forward. Guns and ammunition were dragged
forth to the light of day from the places of concealment,
where they had lain since being smuggled into the country
during full six months. Enlistment at one pound
sterling a day went merrily on. Twenty shillings a day
for being drilled and carrying guns about in a martial
way was not to be refused by the riff-raff, and even those
who did not care to fight at first accepted the pay and
enlisted for the sake of the pay. Drilling and enlisting
went on openly in the streets of Johannesburg, and the
Government, who still hoped for better counsels to prevail,
and was anxious to avoid needless bloodshed, instructed
the officials to withdraw the police altogether, to
avoid a collision with the newly-enlisted soldiers.</p>

<p>The public of Johannesburg, who were indifferent and
apathetic before, on the news of Jameson’s advance
became enthusiastic. Here was a <i>hero</i>; and who does
not delight in worshipping a hero? Those who were
neutral and indifferent before, were neutral no longer.
Those who were enthusiastic before became more so now.
<i>Here was a hero to worship.</i> The few women who had
not fled the pestilence of war, took up the cry, ‘A
hero! A hero!’ Poor women, they could not afford to
pay their passage from Johannesburg to fly the horrors
to come, but they could still manage to find a gay
bonnet and a showy dress to wear to welcome their new
hero. Every garden was robbed to obtain flowers to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
strew the path of Jameson and his brave troopers with
blossoms. ‘Jameson is coming! Jameson is coming!
and will soon be here; out and meet him!’ The
balconies were covered with spectators; the streets were
crowded with enthusiastic men and women, all to
welcome their hero. ‘He is coming. Did not our self-elected
leaders declare that he had forced his way
through the Boers against tremendous odds, and that he
would soon be here? Nay, have not our own brave
pound-a-day troops gone out to meet him and bring
him in in triumph. Ladies, hold your bouquets ready
to cast before his feet as he passes; men, keep your
throats clear to cheer.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, here he comes! here he comes! Hurrah! No, it
is our men leading; he is sure to be behind them. But
see how their horses sweat; they must have ridden hard.
Where is Jameson? Where is Jameson? Alas! their
hero was but clay. They had failed him. He had tried
not to fail them, but fate was stronger; justice and right
were against him; while they were waiting to give him a
glorious and triumphal welcome, he was a prisoner. On
inquiry, it was found that the brave (?) Johannesburg
troops, who had gone forth to aid Jameson, had seen a
few Burghers in the distance, and thinking prudence
the better part of valour, had retired.</p>

<p>Amidst all this revolutionary turmoil, the friends of
the Government in the city of gold kept calm and cool.
For the Government had yet many thousands of friends
in this city. But they were quiet and calm. They had
offered their full assistance to the representatives of the
Government, but had been requested to keep quiet and
cool&mdash;they would be called upon only when it became
necessary, not before. It is believed that the Government
possessed friends and strength sufficient in
Johannesburg alone (without calling in the aid of any
outside Burghers) to crush the rebellion. But the
Government wished to avoid a collision and the consequent
bloodshed as long as peace was possible, and if a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
stronger force was displayed around Johannesburg and
Pretoria than was necessary, it was only to guard against
outside interference, as well as to show Johannesburg the
folly of its ways of seeking reform by force. This display
of force was one of the chief factors which brought about
a peaceful ending to the revolution.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="medium">THE FOLLY OF C. LEONARD AND HIS CLIQUE</span></h3>

<p>Johannesburg, or rather the Reform Committee pretending
to represent Johannesburg, did many inexplicable
things during these few days of excitement.</p>

<p>The Reform Committee had sent a letter to Jameson
(as per agreement?) requesting his aid to obtain their
demands, as is proved by the letter Jameson had received,
signed by five of the leading members of the
Reform Committee. The Reform Committee had promised
Jameson (so he declared) to send two thousand men
to aid him in pushing his way through to Johannesburg.
But what did these brave reformers do&mdash;these followers
of Mirabeau, Rousseau, and who knows, perhaps, Marat?
When Jameson was on his way, as per agreement with
them, to fight with them, and for them, these reformers (?)
sent a deputation to Pretoria and concluded an armistice
with the Government, by which they bound themselves
not to do anything to break the peace, or to give the
Government cause to send a force against them for a
stipulated time. A very laudable thing, and tending
towards a peaceful solution, you would think. Quite
so; only why did they not do so before? Why did
they first entice Jameson to place himself in peril, and in
danger of life on their behalf, and then utterly desert him.
This much can be said on behalf of Jameson, and is freely
acknowledged by the Boers, that he at least was no coward,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
and kept his part of the agreement, even though it was in
an ignoble cause; but it only proves that there <i>is</i> sometimes
honour among thieves, even though the honour
was all on one side here.</p>

<p>How can the action of the Reform Committee be
explained? I am afraid it can be explained no more
than the action of C. Leonard (the leader and president
of the conspirators on the Rand) can be explained. His
cowardly action seemed to have given a very bad example
to his fellow-conspirators, and utterly demoralised
them. What did he do? He threw the fat into the fire
by the issue of his famous manifesto, and when he had
succeeded in thoroughly rousing the public and the
Government, and when Jameson was on his way, in
answer to his invitation to come and aid him and his
gang in their nefarious work&mdash;in short, when he saw the
moment of danger had come, like a cur, he put his tail
between his legs and fled the country, leaving his friends
to get out of their position of danger, where he had
helped to place them, as best they may. When Leonard
had fled, the rest of the conspirators seemed to realise
the danger of their little game of bluff. They had
hoped, as one of their members had said months
before, that the Boer Government would <i>funk</i> it (excuse
the slang), and give them all they demanded.</p>

<p><i>Fools!</i></p>

<p>They had been living amongst the Boers for so long,
and ought to have known that, while there was life, no
Boer would give up the much-treasured and dearly-bought
liberty of the nation.</p>

<p>Strange that these reformers (?) should have run their
noses against a wall, without first making sure that the
wall would give way without hurting their precious noses.
But now, when the mischief was done, they seemed to
realise <i>their</i> danger, and began to stop and consider.
Now, when Jameson was fighting for life or death in
their cause. Now, when thousands of poor women and
children had fled from the scene in destitution and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
want. Now, when the veld along the Vaal and beyond
was covered with these destitute, unprotected, unsheltered,
barely-clothed and starving women and children,
and were depending for daily bread on the very Boers
whom the Reform Committee were trying to destroy.
Now, when many a home was in mourning and woe for
loved ones lost at that terrible railway accident at Glencoe,
when a train, loaded with fugitives from the Rand,
was wrecked, causing the death of many a mother, a
father, a child, or some other loved one, while many a
one lived to bear some terrible mark of the accident for
life. Now, when the whole country was in commotion
and disorder by their action. Now, when the powers of
Europe were glaring in distrust at each other, ready to
spring at each other’s throat, and cause endless war and
bloodshed. Now, when (worst of all for South Africa) a
bitter and insatiable race hatred has been started anew in
the whole of South Africa. Now only, I say, the few
scheming, plotting and unscrupulous persons who had
caused all this, began to bethink themselves, and now
only, because they began to see that their own precious
hides were beginning to be in danger, and followed
in the footsteps of their leader, C. Leonard. They
may plead that they stopped to avoid further bloodshed;
but why have they started shedding blood at all? Why first
invite a foreign force to invade the country on their
behalf, and then desert their accomplices?</p>

<p>No, all excuse is vain, they knew exactly what they
were doing when they began their guilty plots to rob a
nation of freedom and country; and they knew (unless
they were idiots, and fit inmates for the lunatic asylum)
what to expect. The only sensible thing the Reform
Committee ever did was, when Jameson was a prisoner
and the whole mess was spoiled, to accept defeat and lay
down their arms. (I am not referring to the time when
they concluded the armistice, while Jameson’s fate was
undecided, but the following week, when they laid down
their arms, as we shall see farther on).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>But the great guilt of the Reform Committee lay in
their ever having taken up arms, and in ever having
plotted to light the torch of civil war, with no other
object than to throw the South African Republic into
the arms of Rhodes. As to the professed object of the
revolution and the demands contained in the manifesto,
we shall take occasion a little farther on to show how
much&mdash;or how little&mdash;cause there was for the taking up
of arms.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="medium">PRETORIA DURING THE CRISIS</span></h3>

<p>Pretoria, as became the capital of the State, followed
in the footsteps of the Government, and kept calm and
cool during all this bustle and uproar in Johannesburg.
It is true there were a few hot-headed, ignorant young
men (late arrivals mostly) who talked big amongst themselves,
and said that the time had come for England to step
in and again take possession of the Transvaal; but it was
noticed that these young men either kept out of the way
of, or were very quiet in the presence of, the Burghers or
Afrikanders generally. But the majority of, in fact nearly
all, the inhabitants of Pretoria were very orderly and
quiet. There were those who in their inmost hearts
wished for Jameson’s and Johannesburg’s success, and
even said so at first; but as soon as information of Jameson’s
defeat was received, even these became Government
supporters and sympathisers&mdash;at least so they said (?).
But from the first the leading inhabitants and public
men gave the Government to understand that all their
influence would be given to support law and order; and
on the arrival of the news that the country was being invaded
by Chartered troops, the inhabitants held a meeting,
at the suggestion of a leading citizen, and resolved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
to form themselves into a vigilant corps, to protect life
and keep order. This was done. Every man of whatsoever
nationality became a member of the corps, and did
duty night and day, patrolling the streets and vicinity of
the town. All this was done under the orders and with
the assistance of the authorities, thus showing the good
understanding between the Government and the inhabitants
of Pretoria.</p>

<p>The Jingo papers, or rather those belonging to the
association mentioned before, waxed bolder and bolder,
as they saw the evident danger of the State. The Johannesburg
papers, antagonistic to the Government, seemed
to think that the Government would be unable to punish
them now or hereafter, and preached almost open sedition;
and a certain Pretoria paper was by no means far
behind in this respect.</p>

<p>The rebels were encouraged to persevere, and those
who refused to join the malcontents, were incited to join.
The Government was abused and reviled more than before.
According to these papers, the chances of the
Boers to defend themselves were <i>nil</i>; while the success
of the invaders and rebels was assured. With what
courage these papers spoke up <i>now</i>, for they rightly considered
that the Government had no time to waste looking
after them, or punishing sedition preached in their
columns.</p>

<p>But what a change came over these papers when Jameson
was in prison with his officers and men and the Reform
Committee had surrendered unconditionally? Now
there was no abuse. Now the <i>dirty</i> Boers were heard of
no more. But everything was ‘<i>our</i> Government,’ ‘<i>our</i>
Burghers,’ the ‘<i>powerholders</i>,’ all said and written in a
most respectful manner; while in the place of the threats
uttered a few days before, now nothing was heard but a
plea for <i>mercy</i>. The papers were filled with articles
pointing out to the Government what grand and unprecedented
opportunities of displaying their wonted mercy
presented itself. Truly it was a sudden and even ludicrous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
change of face, causing many a smile of amusement
on the face of the impartial observer. But this
amiability did not last long. As soon as things quieted
down, and the anger of the Burghers had subsided, these
cowardly libellers resumed their dirty work, as we shall
have occasion to observe farther on. Those who happened
to be in Pretoria when the news arrived on the Monday
that Jameson was invading the country at the head of
eight hundred Chartered troopers, will remember how
unexpected and hardly credited the news was. It was so
unexpected, and even improbable, that few could be
found to believe the news&mdash;even the Government, it is
said, would not believe the news wired to them from their
own officials at Marico&mdash;that ‘Jameson was marching on
to Johannesburg, and that he refused to turn back.’ The
Government wired for confirmation of the news; and it
was so definitely confirmed that the authorities were forced
to believe it and take the necessary action.</p>

<p>And now the grand military system of the country was
displayed to full advantage. On the Monday afternoon information
was received of the invasion. Every Burgher
was living peacefully and unsuspectingly on his farm,
without the least idea that his country was in danger,
or that a foreign foe had already invaded the country.
And yet, forty hours after the information was received
at Pretoria, a commando had already intercepted Jameson’s
force, and had forced him to turn from his contemplated
course, and in three days he was surrounded
and compelled to surrender ignominiously.</p>

<p>Even this was eclipsed by the further mobilisation of
the Burghers, for, before the week was ended, eight
thousand Burghers were in the neighbourhood of
Johannesburg awaiting the orders of the Commandant-General
to attack, in case the rebellion was pushed,
while in and around Pretoria a like number or more
were encamped.</p>

<p>The excitement for the next few days was intense;
every moment seemed fraught with the gravest results.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
News from the seat of war was anxiously awaited. The
office of <i>The Press</i>, which seemed to be the best informed
of what was going on, was besieged day and
night for news. The wildest reports were flying around,
and when reliable news did come, one hardly knew
whether to believe it or not.</p>

<p>An amusing incident was noticed during the day
when news from Krugersdorp was most intensely desired.</p>

<p>Some boys, who seemed to have grasped the situation
with juvenile sagacity, got hold of a pile of blank sheets
of paper of the size and shape generally used by
newspapers on which to issue special and extraordinary
telegrams during the day. These special telegrams were
eagerly awaited, and even fought for, by the public during
these days of excitement. These youngsters had
noticed this, and with their blank sheets of paper
in their hand, walked about <i>à la</i> newspaper boys, shouting,
‘News from the war. One hundred people killed.
Great slaughter amongst the enemy,’ or anything else
they could think of to excite the people.</p>

<p>To give a single instance of the result. A dignified,
portly and very conscious young man was strolling down
Church Street. But, in spite of his dignity, black suit,
shining boots, and bell topper hat, even he forgot himself
sufficiently for a moment to eagerly run after one of
these boys and snatch one of these supposed special telegrams
from him. Several bystanders, who had already
been caught themselves by the youngsters, were watching
the scene with amusement. The dignified young
man, after having secured the much-desired telegram (?),
walked composedly to one side of the sidewalk, settled
his eyeglasses carefully on his nose, and prepared to read
the startling news, as declared by the amateur newspaper
boys. Those who were watching the party in question
saw a look of astonishment upon the expressive countenance
of the Pretoria dude, followed by an expression of
intense disgust and anger, as, on looking after the laughing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
youngsters, he saw them put their hands in front of
their noses in a most impressive manner. Of course
everybody laughed, while the young man looked as if he
would like to punish the boys with his walking-stick.
But, on second thoughts, he seemed to think that it
would be too undignified, and instead, walked away, expressing
his disgust at the laughter of the bystanders by
the haughty erectness of his head.</p>

<p>While everybody was anxious and excited, the Government
seemed never to lose the calm even tenor of its
ways. Amidst the greatest danger and anxiety, the President
and Commandant-General never for a single
moment lost confidence in their ability to uphold their
position, or to defend their country against the threatening
danger.</p>

<p>Even when the Middleburg commando asked the President
to proclaim martial law, the President remained
calm and moderate, and told his Burghers that there was
no necessity for such extreme measures, and that all that
was necessary could be done without unduly inconveniencing
the public.</p>

<p>After all the excitement and anxiety on the part of the
public, the reader can imagine what a relief it was to
hear of the surrender of Jameson and his band of <i>Freebooters</i>.
It was as if a heavy burden had rolled off the
minds of the public. Those few who did not wish it,
would not believe in Jameson’s surrender, and would
only acknowledge the fact when they saw the invaders
brought into Pretoria as prisoners. But these were only
a few&mdash;enemies to the country, to liberty and justice.
They were of the class of humanity (?) who would sacrifice
everything to attain their own selfish wishes, or to
satisfy their unjust prejudice.

<span class="medium">POSSIBILITIES AND PROBABILITIES</span></h3>

<p>Steve and the rest of the guard hurried their prisoners
forward towards Pretoria, as they feared a rescue.
Rumours of such a rescue were not wanting. During
the night the guard received information that a party of
rebels had left Johannesburg, presumably to rescue
Jameson. Proper precautions were taken, but it proved
unnecessary. Johannesburg had evidently had enough
of fighting (?).</p>

<p>Many stories have been circulated of the bravery (?)
of the Johannesburg soldiers. It is told how bands of
volunteers left the golden city with the avowed object
of teaching the Boers a lesson, and of relieving or
rescuing Jameson. But it is also told how these
martial bands did not proceed far beyond the suburbs
of the town, having seen what to their terror-stricken
eyes appeared to be parties of Boers, but what proved
later on to have been either troops of their own cattle or
parties from their own city.</p>

<p>However, the prisoners were all safely brought into
Pretoria, without any attempt at rescue. The men were
encamped on the racecourse about a quarter-of-a-mile
out of town, under guard, while the officers were kept
in safer quarters in what is locally known as <i>The
Government Hotel</i>, and there they were kept until the
authorities had decided what should be done with
them, and until they were ultimately sent by rail to
the Natal border and handed over to the Imperial
Authorities.</p>

<p>Steve was now once more at home. He was surprised,
even though he expected something of the sort,
to see the squares and outskirts of Pretoria covered
with the tents and waggons of the various commandos,
and his heart swelled with pride and joy as he viewed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
the brave men, who at a moment’s notice had left all
and hurried in answer to the call of duty to defend
country and liberty.</p>

<p>He took frequent walks out amongst the various
commandos, and made many friends amongst the
Burghers, unknown to him up to now. He found them,
unless excited by remarks of recent events, in a happy
and frolicsome mood. ‘Just like a troop of happy
children out for a holiday,’ as he remarked to a friend.
The Burgher out on commando is always full of fun and
frolic when off duty or guard. Various games of skill
and strength are indulged in during the day, while the
evenings are spent in reminiscences of the past:
stories of Kaffir campaigns, of the war against England,
and of the hunting field, passes round. The younger
men would sit and listen attentively and respectfully
as their elders related adventures, dangers and difficulties
experienced during the early years of the <i>voortrekkers</i>.
The old men would feel young again as
they told of the dangers of the chase; of how they
hunted the elephant, the lion, the buffalo, the rhinoceros,
in the days when such game roamed the
country in plenty, and could be found almost without
searching for. How the young men regretted their
ill-fortune, which caused them to be born too late to
participate in such stirring times. How they wished
that they might have lived fifty years ago instead of
in these tame, prosaic days, when one had to take a
three months’ journey to see a rhinoceros or a lion, and
when an elephant could only be seen in a circus show.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is Monday night, 6th of January 1896. It is the
night when the great National Union meeting should
have been held under the chairmanship of Charles
Leonard. The meeting is being held, but only a
committee meeting; but alas and alack Charles Leonard
is not here to take the chair. Charles Leonard is
in Cape Town. Poor Charles Leonard. The body
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
may have been willing, but the heart was <i>too</i> faint.
Such is ever the fate of braggarts. While danger
is yet far away, great deeds are talked of&mdash;then the
braggart is a hero; and, alas for human credulity,
the braggart will always find those who will believe in
him. It is not everybody who can read the heart of
man in his face, or from his tongue, and, least of all,
the <i>public</i>. How easily the PUBLIC&mdash;the <i>people</i>&mdash;as
a whole, will allow a boasting, a glib-tongued, plausible
braggart to lead them by the nose. How disgusting
it is for a student of human nature to see a man
thus lead a crowd of credulous people to believe
in him, to make a hero of him, to accept his statements
for gospel, and all because the man has a
plausible appearance and can <small>TALK</small>.</p>

<p>Johannesburg for a time believed in Charles Leonard!</p>

<p>Now the National Union Committee, self-styled <i>Reform
Committee</i>, by others called the <i>deformed</i> Committee,
was holding a meeting&mdash;to do what? To decide upon
what they should do in reply to President Kruger’s
ultimatum, in which they were given twenty-four hours to
lay down their arms and surrender unconditionally.</p>

<p>But the meeting is strictly private; it is not for the
public to hear the bitter recriminations amongst the
Committee because of blunders and mistakes of the few
leaders, nor the regrets of those who had allowed themselves
to be flattered into joining a movement which, in
their hearts, they knew to be wrong and condemnable;
therefore we shall not report the proceedings, but content
ourselves that we shall know the result of their deliberations
soon, within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>After Steve had safely conducted the prisoners into
their place of confinement, his first act was to report himself
as ready for duty, in case of need, to his own field
cornet, after which he went home, had a bath, and a good
sleep before tea-time.</p>

<p>The members of the amateur debating society are
gathered together once more. The debate goes on every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
night now. The burning questions of the day are
eagerly discussed, and everyone present airs his views
of what <i>ought</i> to be done, what <i>he</i> would do if he had
the control of affairs. Truly the amount of wisdom (?)
wasted in this manner is really alarming. It is a pity
that the wisdom, knowledge and statescraft exhausted in
this private and useless manner could not be bottled up
and labelled, to be used as occasion requires. Such
bottled-up knowledge may even become a marketable
commodity, if some great inventor would only find out
how it is to be preserved. Edison might take the hint
one of these days.</p>

<p>How easy it would make it for public men and
statesmen to buy a little wisdom on certain subjects,
especially when in a dilemma. How easy it would be,
say, for Mr Chamberlain to buy a bottle of wisdom on
‘Home Rule for the Rand,’ or for President Cleveland
on ‘Venezuela Affairs,’ or for President Kruger on ‘How
to deal with the Uitlanders,’ or for Charles Leonard on
‘The safest way to play the game of doubling on the
hounds,’ or for Rhodes on ‘How to make the Afrikander
Bond an Imperial bond (to make him Emperor?),’ or even
on ‘How to make Rhodesia pay.’ So many uses could be
found for such bottled wisdom and knowledge.</p>

<p>Of course, I know that books and papers generally
serve as bottles to contain and preserve much of this
same wisdom and knowledge, but so much of it goes to
waste, so few have the opportunity or means to so
preserve their own knowledge.</p>

<p>We will at least preserve a little of the knowledge and
statescraft exuded at this evening’s conversation in the
sitting-room of Steve’s boarding-house. It will, at least,
serve to show the tendency of public feeling during this
time, when public feeling ran high.</p>

<p>‘Hillo, Steve! Well, I am hanged! is it yourself or
your spirit I see? Well, at least, your hand feels mortal
enough.’ It was Harrison who spoke, shaking Steve
heartily by the hand.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>‘Well, I <i>am</i> glad to see you chaps again,’ said Steve,
as he shook hands all round, ‘and you too, Keith, old
fellow? When did you return, I did not expect to see
you here before to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, when you were gone, we did not seem to enjoy
ourselves, so we returned; we have been here since
Friday.’</p>

<p>‘You are very flattering to pretend that you value my
company so much. Of course, you were curious to know
what was going on here, and therefore you returned,’ said
Steve, laughing.</p>

<p>‘Well, I suppose you are partly right; we could hardly
stay there quietly in the veld without news, while we
knew that history was being made at the rate of a hundred
miles an hour, and as you had <i>skedaddled</i>, we soon
followed suit, only we came in an orderly and comfortable
way, and did not start on <i>shank’s</i> pony as you did,’
replied Keith.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you returned by the way you went. Well, I
think every man to his taste. I wanted to be in at the
death; you preferred a more quiet, neutral position. I
don’t blame you; every man must do as his conscience
tells him.’</p>

<p>‘And how did you fare, Steve? You might give us a
relation of your adventures,’ begged Harrison.</p>

<p>Steve gave a rough outline of his adventures since he
left the party on the Vaal River, and when he told them
that he was present at, and participated in, the Battle of
Doornkop, he was plied with questions from all sides, to
which he replied as best and as modestly as he could.</p>

<p>‘How many Boers were there against Jameson,
Joubert?’ queried a late arrival (who was also a professed
Boer hater), named Hastings. Steve had noticed
his antagonism towards the Government of the country,
and was not at all well disposed towards him.</p>

<p>‘Well, if you wish to know how many Boers were or
are against Jameson, I could not tell you exactly; but if
I had a copy of the last census papers I might be able
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
to give you some idea of the number. If it will help
you, however, I may tell you that <i>every</i> Boer or Afrikander
(as we call them) in South Africa is against
Jameson.’</p>

<p>The others present laughed at this little sally of
Steve’s.</p>

<p>‘Of course, you know, I don’t mean who is against
him in principle, I mean how many Boers (or Afrikanders
as you prefer to call them) <i>fought</i> against Jameson.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, why did you not say so then? Well, I will draw
it as mild as possible,’ said Steve, with some sarcasm,
which he could hardly conceal, ‘so as to save your feelings;
for if I were to give you the exact number, you
would not believe me and would think I was trying to
bluff you. Well, there were no more than one hundred
Boers actually fighting against Jameson and his band at
the Battle of Doornkop.’</p>

<p>‘Bah! you must think I am a green ’un. Do you
think I will believe that one hundred Boers could defeat
eight hundred drilled English troops, and armed with
artillery too? Tell it to the marines.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, so you <i>do</i> call them English troops?’ asked Steve.</p>

<p>‘Well, of course, they are not Imperial troops actually,
but they are mostly Englishmen, and have been drilled
and disciplined by English officers, and on the English
principle, but are not British troops.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I see, that means, of course, that if they had succeeded,
and had subjugated the Transvaal with the
assistance of Johannesburg, they would have been English
or even Imperial troops, and would have been
honoured and owned by England; now that they have
been defeated, of course, they are only an irresponsible
band of British subjects, for whom and whose deeds
nobody is responsible. I have even heard that some
Englishmen assert that Jameson’s men are really mostly
Afrikanders, that is because they have been defeated.’</p>

<p>‘But, Steve,’ said Harrison, ‘do you really mean to
say that one hundred Boers actually defeated Jameson?’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<p>‘I will swear that no <i>more</i> than one hundred Boers
took part in the Battle of Doornkop; that would be on
the safe side, for I <i>know</i> that there were less,’ said Steve.
‘Of course, there were nearly or fully a thousand Burghers
in the vicinity of Krugersdorp, but they were all too far
away to take part in the fight. Some parties of them
were guarding the various roads, so that if Jameson did
escape at Doornkop he would have been pulled up at
some other spot. Others again were watching the road
to Johannesburg, so that if Johannesburg <i>did</i> send any
help to Jameson, <i>they</i> would have had somebody to look
after them before they could join forces with the invaders.
And lastly, as a matter of fact, a party of
Burghers was preparing to take Jameson by storm, and
was only prevented from doing so by Jameson’s hoisting
the white flag and surrendering.’</p>

<p>‘Very interesting and spicy indeed,’ remarked Hastings
in an ironical, unbelieving way.</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed, and in spite of the spice, hardly to the
taste of some people,’ retorted Steve.</p>

<p>‘Well, your Government has managed to overcome
Jameson, as I believe, by force of numbers, and because
Jameson’s men were starved, fatigued and out of ammunition;
but it remains to be seen whether the same
game can be played with Johannesburg, which is prepared
and well armed and provisioned. That will be a
nut too hard for your Government’s knuckles to crack.’</p>

<p>‘To answer your first assertion first. I have already
stated that Jameson really had the force of numbers at
Doornkop. As to being starved, they had, as I happen
to know from their own men, plenty of provisions, and
found at regular intervals buildings placed there for the
purpose, in which provisions in plenty for man and
horse were found. In fact, one man told me they found
tables laid ready and laden with food; they had only to
sit down and eat. As to fatigue, the majority of the
Burghers travelled as far in half the time as Jameson’s
troopers did, and that without preparation and without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
much provision. The assertion that the Chartered
troops were out of ammunition when they surrendered
is the most foolish of all; for I can tell you that the
Government took a rich booty in ammunition alone. In
fact, more ammunition was taken from Jameson, than
the Boers possessed when they began the war against
England in 1880.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe it,’ asserted Hastings.</p>

<p>‘Well, I can say this much, if Steve says it is so, and
that he saw it himself, I will believe it, for I have never
known him to tell a lie,’ said Keith.</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe Steve <i>can</i> tell a lie,’ approved
Harrison.</p>

<p>Steve went on, as if he was unconscious of the interruption.
He never lost his temper.</p>

<p>‘As to Johannesburg, I am not a betting man, but I
am willing to go a little bet that Johannesburg won’t
fight. If Johannesburg cared to face the Burgher forces,
she would hardly have allowed Jameson to be defeated
and captured without at least an effort to rescue and
assist him. No, my boy, Johannesburg has no fighting
men. It is all bluff. Of course, there are a few brave
men in Johannesburg, who, for a righteous cause, would
certainly be able to give a good account of themselves.
But brave men would hardly consent to be lead by a
Leonard or such as he. No. I will tell you the position
in a few words.</p>

<p>‘The great amalgamator wanted to amalgamate the
Transvaal and Rhodesia for the sake of the Rand goldfields.
The plan of campaign was to send a few men to
the Rand to preach rebellion and revolution.</p>

<p>‘The next thing would be to strengthen the Rand
people by sending outside help, for the Rand by itself
could do but little, and, besides, would not always be
willing to do exactly as ordered by their would-be leaders.
The best outside help at hand was obtainable from
Rhodesia; by sending troops from Rhodesia, which
really is British territory, would embroil England in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
the matter, and thus England would be forced to take a
hand in the game. It was hoped that if England once
took a hand in the game, she would play to suit the cards
of her only great privy councillor in South Africa. Now
the outside help has been nipped in the bud and England
is disowning the whole plot (of course it having
failed so far). Thus Johannesburg is isolated and divided
amongst themselves, one party being for revolution, one
party being for the present Government. Do you
see any chance for the Reform Committee to continue
their foolish plot? Say, now, for instance, they did persist
in trying their strength against the Government. In a
week the Government would lay Johannesburg in ruins,
or if the Government wanted to be merciful and spare
the innocents in the town, in three months they would be
starved out if they were not driven to surrender by thirst
long before then. No, Johannesburg could stand neither
a siege nor an attack from the Burghers. Their only hope
for success (England) has failed them.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know that England may not even yet take
a hand in the game on her own account? The Transvaal
is a blot on the face of the South African map as far as
England is concerned, and it has been believed all along
that England has only been waiting for an excuse to step
in and once more take possession of the country.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I do not believe England will try such a
trick. Firstly, because I believe England as a power and
Englishmen as a nation have yet some honour left.
Secondly, even if England did wish to forget honour and
treaty obligations, not to speak of right, justice and the
right of nations. I say, even if England did wish to
do so, I believe she <i>dare</i> not do so. She dares not,
because the glaring injustice would arouse the world
against her. It would be an injustice more glaring than
the Armenian atrocities even, for from the Turks everybody
expects injustice, oppression and cruelty, while from
England one would expect at least common justice. From
England one would expect that she would recognise her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
own treaties, for England is supposed to be, and has
always been believed to be, a highly civilised power.
England is a Christian country, and England is governed
on Christian principles. Should England forget her old
traditions of fairplay, justice and honour, the rest of the
world would pull her up much sharper than they would
Turkey.</p>

<p>‘Then leaving out the rest of the world, England would
have her hands fairly full in South Africa alone, should
she enter upon such an unjust war. If she fights the
Transvaal under present circumstances, she would have
to fight the Free State, which has already called out a
portion of her Burghers to be ready in case of emergency.
She would have to fight the entire Afrikander
nation in South Africa, including many Uitlanders, or
people of foreign birth, and even many Englishman of
long residence in South Africa who have learned to value
self-government and deprecate Downing Street Government.’</p>

<p>‘Why, <i>do</i> you believe for a moment that the whole
Afrikander nation could beat England?’</p>

<p>‘I believe that if England were <span class="smcap">Free</span>, and willing to
put out her full strength against the Afrikander nation,
that she would conquer in the end, for every Afrikander
Burgher killed would leave a vacancy in their ranks;
while, if one British soldier is killed, two could always
be found to take his place. But even if England is able
to put out her full might against us, it would be a long
and bloody struggle. For every Burgher killed three or four
British soldiers would bite the dust. In his native land,
and amongst his native hills and mountains, the Boer can
take long odds against himself. Then the fight will be
on land and not on the sea, where England is supreme.
Then again the Boers will always choose their own
battlefield, and you ought to know by this time that a
Boer knows how to choose a battlefield to his own
advantage. The British forces would only be attacked
where their superior numbers and arms would be of no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
advantage. In short, it would be a warfare on the
guerrilla system, in which the Boers excel all other
nations, and by the time England had conquered the
Afrikanders (if she did conquer them), which will only
be when at least half of them have been killed; by the
time she had conquered them, I say, thousands, if not
tens of thousands, of English soldiers will have perished
in the South African veld by the bullet or by starvation.
Now, I come to the chief reason why England does not
<i>dare</i> to undertake such an unjust war, or rather I should
say, why the English <i>Government</i> does not dare to do
so: And that is because the British people, being a free
people, with a voice in their own Government, would
never allow their Government to undertake such a cruel&mdash;to
both sides&mdash;and unjust war, and have thousands
of their soldiers and relatives killed, all to please a few
grasping millionaires such as Rhodes and Beit, or a few
conspiring, speculating attorneys, etc., who wish to
obtain power as well as riches.’</p>

<p>Steve became quite eloquent in his earnestness.</p>

<p>‘Do you think, then, that England will leave everything
to the Boers to do as they think fit? Will she, do
you think, allow your Government to shoot down her
subjects in Johannesburg, without giving them aid? or
if Johannesburg surrenders to the ultimatum, unconditionally,
would England allow the Boers to shoot the
Reform Committee as rebels, which would probably be
done if nothing was done to prevent it?’</p>

<p>‘If it were done, it would only be what they deserve.
But it will <i>not</i> be done, at least, not without a fair trial.
You may be sure the Government is not going to do anything
rash, and sacrifice all the advantages they have
obtained. Everything will be done legally and according
to the laws of the country.’</p>

<p>‘It remains to be seen,’ said Hastings, walking out
whistling, giving Steve to understand that he had had
enough argument for once.

<h3 id="CHAP_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="medium">JOHANNESBURG SURRENDERS UNCONDITIONALLY&mdash;HOME
RULE FOR THE RAND</span></h3>

<p>The following day being Tuesday and the day during
which the Johannesburg malcontents would decide whether
they would surrender or fight, everybody was on the
tenter hooks of expectation and anxiety to know what
would be decided.</p>

<p>The High Commissioner, who had been in Pretoria
since Saturday the 4th January, had recommended
the Reform Committee to surrender to the Government,
as it was useless for them to attempt a struggle. Sir
Jacobus de Wet, the British agent, had advised the
British subjects to return to ways of peace and order.</p>

<p>The Reform Committee might have wished to proceed
to extremes, but they saw that they had not a leg
to stand upon. No more outside help could be hoped
for. The High Commissioner had acted honourably
and in good faith to the Government of the South African
Republic, and in the only way he could act without
sacrificing British honour. He had assured the malcontents
that they could not expect British aid if they
went beyond the pale of the law.</p>

<p>Being unable to obtain outside help, and as even the
majority of Johannesburg refused to fight except those
who received one pound sterling a day, the Reform
Committee did the only thing left them to do, and surrendered
unconditionally to the Government.</p>

<p>Of course they did not acknowledge that they surrendered
because they could not do anything else, and
because they knew that with Jameson’s defeat their whole
plot had failed. No, they only surrendered to please
the High Commissioner, and as they would not fight (to
please the High Commissioner), they declared that they
expected the High Commissioner to fight for them and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
obtain for them their demands. In fact, they shifted the
whole responsibility of past, present and future on to the
High Commissioner, and consequently on to the Imperial
Government. When Steve heard of the surrender
he threw up his hat and shouted hurrah, and ran to the
telegraph office and sent the following telegram to his
mother:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,&mdash;Johannesburg has surrendered unconditionally.
South Africa may reckon on some years
of peace again; no fear of further disturbances.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Foolish Steve. He did not think that England <i>would</i>
interfere after all and keep the country in a state of unrest
and uncertainty for months after, through holding
out hopes to the discontented that she would force the
Government to accede to their demands.</p>

<p>This uncertainty was kept up for months, and this uncertainty
obtains to this very day when I write this
(15th April 1896). England took it upon herself, after
everybody thought that all was settled, and after the
President had already promised certain privileges to the
discontented, to dictate to the South African Republic
what she should do and what she should not do, and
this in contradiction to the London Convention, which
she had only just declared she would uphold in its
entirety.</p>

<p>It is true that Mr Chamberlain sent what he called
friendly advice only, but everybody knew that it was intended
to be taken as a demand. And how was this
advice sent?</p>

<p>Mr Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies,
drew up a long despatch in which he raked up long
forgotten incidents of South African history. He reminded
President Kruger of past friendliness shown by
England to the Transvaal and Afrikanders. But he
forgot to mention one incident of the overwhelming
number of times that England had acted in an unfriendly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
and even unjust manner. He reminded the Government
of the South African Republic that England had
shown mercy in Bechuanaland to certain Afrikanders
who had resisted English pretensions there. But Mr
Chamberlain forgot to mention Slachtersnek, where Boers
were hung like felons on a gallows for resisting England.
He forgot to mention Boomplaats, where Boers again
were shot&mdash;murdered&mdash;for fighting for their own country
and for hard-earned freedom.</p>

<p>Mr Chamberlain did not remind President Kruger
that the Government of the South African Republic was
in possession of a certain document (for which Piet Retief
and forty of his comrades gave their lives) by which
they could prove that Natal belongs to the Boers by
every just claim and by every law of nations.</p>

<p>Mr Chamberlain did not remind President Kruger
that England took from the Free State Boers the richest
diamond mine in the world, and, out of a remnant of
shame, forced the Free State to take £90,000 for the
Kimberley diamond mines&mdash;£90,000 for what is worth
£90,000,000. But if it was worth 90 pence, every
country has the right to keep what it has, without being
forced to sell it. Alas no, Mr Chamberlain was not
shamed into telling President Kruger that England had
persecuted and oppressed the Boers for the last ninety
years; he did not ask the President to heap coals of fire
on the heads of the British nation by showing the magnanimity
to the British subjects that Britain refused the
Boers.</p>

<p>Mr Chamberlain capped his despatch by <i>advising</i> (?)
President Kruger to give Johannesburg a variety of
<i>Home Rule</i>. Alas, the inconsistency of man. Mr Chamberlain,
who is a Unionist, and opponent of Home Rule
for Ireland, advises the South African Republic to give
Home Rule to Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Johannesburg is a town in the heart of the South
African Republic, inhabited by a mining community of all
nationalities in the world, a large proportion of whom are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
British subjects. And for the sake of the British subjects
in Johannesburg the district is to be isolated and
Home Rule given to it, while Ireland is a country
inhabited by a great nation, who are living in their own
native land, and who are kept down by force of arms.
To this nation, unjustly conquered by England long
ago, and kept under ever after only by England’s military
strength, to this nation Home Rule is refused by
Mr Chamberlain and his party. By what moral right
can Mr Chamberlain demand, or even advise, the South
African Republic to grant Home Rule to Johannesburg?
I have heard somewhere a very useful adage, ‘Sweep in
front of your own door before you sweep in front of
your neighbour’s door.’ Very homely, but to the point,
and really I would recommend it to Mr Chamberlain’s
study.</p>

<p>This interference in our internal affairs by Mr Chamberlain,
or rather this advice as to our internal affairs by
Mr Chamberlain, would have been received with gratitude
and thanks, if it had been given, as advice <i>ought</i> to
be given, viz., privately and confidentially, but Mr Chamberlain
was playing to the Jingo gallery. In truth, it was
not meant for honest advice, it was done to please the
friends of the Chartered Company, and to do this more
effectually Mr Chamberlain, in contradiction to all diplomatic
usages and etiquette, published his <i>advice</i> (?) to
President Kruger in London before despatching the same
to its destination.</p>

<p>We shall show farther on how this <i>advice</i> (?) was
received in Pretoria.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="medium">THE CHARTERED PRESS AGAIN&mdash;JONAH!</span></h3>

<p>And who were the people for whom Mr Chamberlain
was asking Home Rule? For people who ever since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
they entered the country have openly abused the Government,
have tried in every way to abuse the freedom and
liberty they enjoy in this country, by libelling and traducing
the people and Government of the country.
People who stood up in open rebellion against the
Government, people who did not scruple to call in a
band of foreign freebooters to help them to raise an unjust
revolution. A people whose leaders openly declared
that they had thirty thousand rifles to carry on the rebellion,
and when they had solemnly promised to give
up all arms gave up two thousand five hundred. Who
did those leaders deceive? Did they deceive their
followers when they declared they possessed thirty
thousand rifles? or did they deceive the Government
when they declared they possessed only two thousand
five hundred?</p>

<p>These people had come to the Transvaal to make
money. They had made fabulous fortunes out of Transvaal
soil. And to show their gratitude to the Government
of the country, who had fostered them and protected
their industry, and had done everything possible to please
them and prosper them, they evinced their gratitude by
maturing the vilest plot known to history to overthrow
this Government. This much for the rebels. On the other
hand, the people for whom Mr Chamberlain asked
Home Rule, ridiculed his proposal and would have no
more of his home rule than they wanted of Downing Street
rule. Those who were not satisfied with the Boer rule
simply wanted to rule themselves, not only in Johannesburg,
but the whole country. If they could not get the
franchise, by which they could get to rule the whole
country, then they would not have any rule at all other
than they have now.</p>

<p>Then what would Mr Chamberlain do with the large
proportion, if not the majority, of the inhabitants of
Johannesburg, who are, and have always been satisfied
with the present Government. <i>They</i> would have no other
Government than their own legitimate Government.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
But the whole proposal is so ridiculous that it would be
foolish to discuss it further here. We shall proceed with
our story. The utter ridiculousness of giving Home Rule
to Johannesburg must be apparent to everyone who
knows the state of affairs, and those who do not know
have only to read this story to the end and they will see
for themselves what the Jingo element in Johannesburg
is composed of.</p>

<p>Now as regards the reception of Mr Chamberlain’s
Home Rule Despatch. We have already stated that the
<i>people</i> of Johannesburg ridiculed it. But the Jingoes
received it with joy.</p>

<p>‘Now at last,’ thought they, ‘England is committed;
and either the South African Republic must knuckle
under and do as the Secretary of State demands, or&mdash;fight
Great Britain; once more “Rule Britannia” is
sung with gusto. Mr Chamberlain has restarted, or very
nearly so, the gassing and warlike talk of Jingoism. It
will not be his fault if the peace is not broken once
more.’</p>

<p>Now what will the Government of the South African
Republic do? Will it brave the anger of the British
Lion? or will it knuckle down and beg?</p>

<p>No! Once more the calm, manly and firm old man,
the President of the Transvaal, stands to his guns, and
fearlessly sends the Secretary of State for the Colonies of
Great Britain a dignified, friendly, but <i>firm</i> reply, in
which the assertions of Mr Chamberlain are fairly refuted,
and the right of England to interfere in the internal
affairs of the South African Republic totally and distinctly
denied.</p>

<p>At last the Jingoes rejoice, and many a firm friend of
the Republic holds his breath in anticipation of disaster
to its liberties. The President has thrown down the
gauntlet, and England cannot but take it up and force
the Transvaal at the point of the bayonet to accede to
its unjust demands, or maybe to take away its freedom
from the Transvaal altogether. Many began to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
their preparations anew for the great struggle they
thought they saw inevitable. But what was the surprise
to many, disappointment to some, and joy to others,
when the cables brought the news that England had
quietly and tamely received President Kruger’s lesson in
etiquette to Mr Chamberlain, and calm request to ‘mind
your own business.’ Such was indeed the case, for Mr
Chamberlain declared, in the House of Commons, that
he had no intention to press the acceptance of his <i>suggestion</i>
on President Kruger. Once more <small>PEACE</small> seemed
possible and probable. Once more the rival factions
argued their various contentions with a calmer and more
dignified spirit. Only the Chartered Press in South
Africa and in England raged louder and louder as peace
became probable. It seemed as if Mr Rhodes was aware
that the only hope he had for his actions to be passed
over or condoned was in war&mdash;war at any price, was
consequently the cry of the Chartered Press. For if war
with Great Britain brought to a successful issue Mr
Rhodes’ scheme, viz., the suppression of the Transvaal
Republic, then Mr Rhodes might reasonably hope that
no inquiry would be held as to what part he had in the
plot. Such an inquiry must be averted at any price if
possible; for such an inquiry meant that light will be
thrown on many a dark deed and conspiracy in the past
life of the arch conspirator and his partners and subordinates.
Such an inquiry would show that the trusted
high official, Privy Councillor to the Queen, and Prime
Minister of an important British colony, managing
director of a large territory (ruled under a British
Charter), had betrayed his trust in every case, and had
brought dishonour upon his Queen and country; and
would bring to the light of day the names of partners in
the plot, never suspected, or, if suspected, only whispered
as yet.</p>

<p>To avert such an inquiry then, all the influence of <i>gold</i>,
power, position and birth, of Rhodes and his friends were
brought to bear on newspapers, great and small; on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Government officials, and even the ministry in power in
England, to avert the dreaded inquiry&mdash;honour and truth
even were sacrificed. Mr Rhodes totally denied all complicity
in the plot&mdash;at first. But in spite of his denial,
all his actions proved his guilt. His consciousness of
guilt forced him to at once resign his premiership of the
Cape Colony. Then he slunk off to England to avoid
the reproachful looks of his betrayed fellow-ministers, and
trusting friends, and also to set in motion his hireling
Press in England, to defend or to justify, by hook or
crook, his actions, and patch up his wrecked reputation.
But even in England his guilty conscience would not let
him rest; again he slunk off to the wilderness of Rhodesia
that time. But to avoid meeting his duped friends in
Cape Town again, he went <i>via</i> the Red Sea this time.
But the steamer that bore him refused to carry such
political guilt, and cast him like a Jonah forth to proceed
as best he might. Arrived in Rhodesia again, his
advent seemed to be the signal for a native rebellion;
a rebellion which is raging to this day (30th June 1896),
and the consequences of which no one can foresee, except
that there seems to be a probability of many more innocents
being lost, in addition to the hundreds already
lost, in the struggle against the natives by the inhabitants&mdash;a
struggle that was caused solely through Mr Rhodes
allowing the police forces, which ought to have protected
the country, to be sent on a filibustering expedition
against a friendly neighbour&mdash;a neighbour who, after
being attacked in a cowardly and dastardly way by the
Chartered Company, offered to fight the company’s battles
against the Matabele out of sheer generosity and pity
for the innocent inhabitants; but more of this anon.</p>

<p>Mr Rhodes’ absence in Rhodesia did not prevent his
agents from continuing the newspaper fight against the
Transvaal Government and people. Mr Rhodes’ actions
were excused in a hundred different ways. Some denied
his complicity in the plot altogether; while others, forced
to admit his guilt, said he did it to lay bare some fancied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
plot between the Transvaal and Germany. In short, so
many contradictory excuses emanated from the Rhodesian
Press and party that one excuse confounded the other;
but every impartial observer could see that these excuses,
one and all, were rotten to the core. There being no
defence that would stand the light of day, the Chartered
combination of hireling newspapers, headed by the <i>Times</i>
of London, saw that all they could do was to abuse the
other side, viz., the enemies of Mr Rhodes and his company,
and thus find an excuse in the bad (?) administration
of the South African Republic Government, giving
forth that Mr Rhodes sought to bring a better (?) government
into existence in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>To obtain their object, viz., the old one of blackening
the people of the Transvaal and its Government, no
expense of either money or truth was spared. But they
overreached themselves. The more they <i>lied</i> the more
their lies were exposed and proved to be untrue. To-day
the <i>Times</i> would publish some telegram from Johannesburg,
telling of some imaginary wrong perpetrated by the
Transvaal Government, but the next day the assertion
would be disproved by some authority not to be denied.
In short, so apparent was the untruth of their statements,
that the public soon learned to discredit all statements
coming from newspapers known to be Chartered. Even
Mr Chamberlain felt constrained to warn the public to
accept with caution these interested wires from Johannesburg.</p>

<p>We shall see farther on how the Transvaal Government
triumphed against all these truth-ignoring libellers.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="medium">OUT OF EVIL CAME GREAT GOOD TO THE TRANSVAAL</span></h3>

<p>Verily, never was the saying realised to a fuller extent,
that ‘out of evil cometh good,’ than was the case with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
the Transvaal after the events of January 1896. On
New Year’s Day Stephen Joubert thought that never was
his country and people in greater peril than they then
were. And even though he hoped and trusted that they
would at least escape the extreme peril of national suppression
and total loss of freedom, yet he dared hardly
hope that this great evil would bring forth great good.
He hardly hoped for the Transvaal to retain the full
prestige and strength that she possessed before the
crisis. How great must his joy now be, in common
with his fellow-countrymen, to find his country’s power,
prestige and good name doubled and trebled since New
Year’s Day. First of all, he read with joy the cables
announcing that his country possessed the sympathy and
goodwill of all the nations of the civilised world. He
saw that Germany, France and Russia, especially the
former, were determined to see the Transvaal’s independence
maintained. He saw that the German
Emperor sent a cable of congratulation to President
Kruger that left no doubt of his opinion. Indeed, his
opinion was expressed so plainly that England feared
German interference, and sent a flying squadron to
Delagoa Bay, to prevent Germany from landing troops
at that port to aid the Transvaal&mdash;<i>a fool’s errand</i>.</p>

<p>Transvaal never asked for German or any European
aid!</p>

<p>After the Transvaal Government had foregone its
just right of punishing Jameson and his men, and had
most magnanimously given them up to the British
Government to be punished according to British law,
the Transvaal acquired a new (?) virtue in the opinion
of the world. The enemies of the Boers had always
described them to be of a savage and cruel nature.
Now the world saw a practical demonstration of the fact
that the Boers were Christians! Christians as well in
deed as in name. For they had shown mercy to those
who had refused mercy to them and theirs. But even
this act of mercy was not recognised by the enemies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
of the Republic. Motives of policy were ascribed to
this act by the Chartered Press. Not even all those who
were the recipients of this mercy were grateful for the
mercy received. One of them wrote to the papers that
the President had no alternative but to spare their lives,
as they had not surrendered unconditionally, but that
their lives had been promised on the field of battle.
We have already shown that their lives were only safeguarded
until handed over to the Government in
Pretoria, and that the Government would then decide as
to their ultimate fate. But even if it were granted that
their lives had been promised in full, their liberties were
still in the hands of the Transvaal Government, and for
that liberty, which they had forfeited, they might at least
have shown some gratitude. But gratitude does not
seem to be part of the constitution of filibusters, even
when the filibusters are of good birth and position.</p>

<p>However, if all the prisoners were not grateful, and did
not recognise the mercy shown, the world did. Even
the Queen of England gave her subjects a lesson in
gratitude by thanking President Kruger for the mercy
shown to the prisoners. The South African Republic
had taken another step higher in the estimation of the
world.</p>

<p>Steve now saw his countrymen holding the happy
reputation of being patriotic, brave, fearless and merciful.
Soon he saw his Government slowly acquiring a
greater reputation still&mdash;that of possessing great diplomatic
skill. Mr Chamberlain is supposed to be one of
the most skilful of statesmen and diplomatists, and yet
it soon became apparent to the world that he had found
his match in President Kruger. It was like a skilful
game of cards. It is true that President Kruger
possessed the better hand, but it is also true that he played
his cards with marvellous skill and precision, while it
cannot be denied that Mr Chamberlain weakened his
hand considerably by several false moves.</p>

<p>Mr Chamberlain has one grand excuse for his want of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
success so far to outwit President Kruger, and that is
that President Kruger is working in a just and holy
cause, while Mr Chamberlain is trying to uphold an
unjust cause. He is trying to paint the rotten sepulchre
of a chartered company white, and to prevent the rottenness
within from being exposed. He is trying to save
from the storm a house built upon the sand; while the
house President Kruger is shielding is built upon a rock,
the Rock of Ages.</p>

<p>When the Governor of Natal congratulated the President
upon the mercy he had shown his foes, the
President replied that the South African Republic was
governed upon Christian principles&mdash;and so it is, thank
God.</p>

<p>We have shown that the world gave the Transvaal
its due when it recognised the mercy shown to Jameson
and his men. How much more did the world applaud
the President when the territories of the Chartered
Company, being ravished by a native rebellion, he
offered to allow his Burghers to go and help Rhodesia
in its moment of danger; verily that was heaping coals
of living fire upon the heads of Rhodes and company,
especially as many Burghers were eager and willing to
go and assist, and did not go only because their offer
was not accepted. We can hardly blame the High
Commissioner for not accepting the Presidents offer,
for it would hardly tend to uphold England’s vaunted
supremacy in South Africa if the Boers had to succour
British territory from the Matabele; but the people of
Rhodesia suffered for the refusal, and is suffering still.</p>

<p>But even though his offer was refused, President
Kruger moved his country a step higher in the world’s
estimation. One would almost have thought that the
Transvaal could have afforded to rest upon the laurels
gained during the first few months of the year, but the
greatest of all was yet to come. After Johannesburg’s
surrender, the Reform Committee were arrested and
arraigned for trial. The Government possessed such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
overwhelming evidences of guilt that the prisoners
considered that there was nothing left for them but
to plead <i>guilty</i>&mdash;the four leaders to ‘<i>High Treason</i>,’
and the rest to minor offences. The four leaders were
sentenced to death by an impartial judge, specially sworn
in, to ensure having a non-political and disinterested
man upon the bench, and the rest were sentenced to
two years’ imprisonment, £2000 fine, and three years’
banishment.</p>

<p>It is needless to enter into the world-wide interest
taken in the trial and its results. It is needless to
enter farther into the justice of the sentences. It is
sufficient to state that all fair-minded men had to
acknowledge that the sentence was deserved, and yet
the day after sentence was pronounced, the Executive
Council commuted the death sentences, followed later
by giving all the prisoners their liberties after the
various fines had been paid. Was ever such clemency
shown by human government? Would such mercy
have been shown by any other government for such
offences? We doubt it.</p>

<p>We regret to say that even after this, the enemies of
the Transvaal did not cease even yet to attempt doing
it harm. But the Transvaal can afford to treat these&mdash;as
a mastiff treats the barkings of curs&mdash;with contempt.
It is sufficient that the Transvaal has seized its opportunity,
and by the blessing of God has turned the
evil intended her, into good.</p>

<p>The world has heard President Kruger’s reply to the
deputation of mayors from all South Africa. When
the deputation came to thank the President for the
magnanimity shown to the prisoners, he replied by
laying his hand on a Bible and saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I recognise no rule or law for my deeds and works
but what is contained in this book.’</p>

<p>The world now knows the policy of the Transvaal&mdash;England
knows it, let her respect it.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that Mr Stead, the bitter enemy of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
the Transvaal, and the friend of Rhodes and his company,
has to acknowledge that President Kruger had
diplomatically scored against his enemies every time. It
could not be otherwise. For not only, as we have
shown, was the cause of the Transvaal just, but President
Kruger had received his first lessons in diplomacy
from English statesmen, and had learned to be careful
how he exposed his policy when dealing with English
diplomats. It must be remembered that Mr Kruger
was already vice-president of the Transvaal when English
statesmen unjustly annexed the country. Mr Kruger
was also a member of the triumvirate who allowed themselves
to be duped into a peace in 1881 (after having
been victorious in every battle), by which England
retained the suzerainty of the Transvaal, which was
only got rid of in the London Convention of 1884.
No wonder if President Kruger refused to accept an
unconditional invitation to visit England to confer with
Mr Chamberlain on matters which only concerned the
internal government of the Transvaal. Once caught,
twice shy! President Kruger already saw the cloven
foot of the 1881 Convention reappear, when Mr Chamberlain
advised him to weaken his Government by
giving Home Rule to Johannesburg; and when this
failed, to offer to safeguard the South African Republic
from all attacks against its independence from British or
foreign territory on certain conditions, viz., on the
franchise being given to all Uitlanders. We have
already seen the President’s reply to the Home Rule
scheme. To the offer of England’s promised safeguard
on condition that the Uitlanders were given the franchise,
the President replied that ‘the Transvaal was
already safeguarded against attack from British territory
by international law. And as regards safeguarding the
Republic against other foreign powers, the Transvaal
had never asked to be thus safeguarded’&mdash;Scored again!
It would require volumes to detail all the events of the
invasion of the Republic, or the results of the crisis of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
1896, or the various good results of the Government’s
wise policy of firmness, combined with gentleness and
mercy. Yet we cannot end this chapter without referring
to the greatest good of all that came to South Africa
out of the intended evil. We refer to the great <i>Spirit of
Unity</i> that came to the Afrikander nation of South
Africa. Never was such glorious unity of purpose, of
opinion and feeling, seen in South Africa. From the
Cape to the Zambesi the holy spirit of patriotism and
unity was awakened and displayed in beautiful colours
of fellow feeling and love of country and people. Never
was truer word spoken than when a man of position
exclaimed in Pretoria, on receipt of the news of Jameson’s
defeat: ‘To-day the nation of South Africa is
reborn.’ Afrikander national feeling was reborn indeed,
never to die again. The most bitter political opponents
of President Kruger in the country became his most
staunch supporters. All party feelings were forgotten
and forgiven. All territorial or trade jealousies between
states and colonies were cast aside. One cry of shame
went up against the plotters from town to town, from
state to state, from colony to colony. And the people
of South Africa became as one man.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that there were certain Imperial
Jingoes who belonged to the same faction as the plotters,
and who sided with the filibusters and rebels. But
these were in the small minority, and are hardly to be
recognised, except where they showed forth in their true
colours, as when they hooted their own governor in
Maritzburg for having upheld his country’s honour when
in Pretoria, and expressed his regret to President Kruger
that Englishmen should have acted in such a dishonourable
way. Or again, when a party of young roughs
in the Cape Colony seized upon a single unarmed young
Burgher, because he defended his adopted country, and
tarred and feathered him. Such methods of expressing
their feelings and opinions only served to prove the
badness of their cause. But on the other hand, we have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
the great proof of sympathy and goodwill expressed to
the Transvaal by all its most peaceful and honourable
men. Even in Johannesburg most men of South
African birth, of Dutch or English parentage, supported
the Government. And in Pretoria and other towns, the
Government received the unqualified support and sympathy
of nearly every citizen of respectability, Burgher
or not.</p>

<p>Then again we have the practical proof of sympathy
shown by the Free State! Without a moment’s
delay the Free State called up her Burghers, and
marched them up to the Transvaal borders, ready to
assist her sister Republic in case of need. Every Free
Stater was as ready as any Transvaaler to risk his life
to uphold Republicanism in South Africa. Then again we
have the warm sympathy expressed for the Transvaal at
public meetings at such places as Graaff Reinet, and the
Paarl in the Cape Colony. Sympathy which was ready
to take practical form at any moment if needed. Then
we must not forget to mention that Steve was agreeably
disappointed in Mr Hofmeyr, the leader of the Afrikander
party in the Cape Colony. He, with many others, had
seen with regret Mr Hofmeyr assisting Mr Rhodes to
undermine the aspirations of the Republic towards
northern and western expansion. But now it was seen
that Mr Hofmeyr, in common with many others, had
only been deceived and infatuated by Rhodes. Therefore
Steve, in common with all Afrikanders, was pleased
when Mr Hofmeyr expressed such warm sympathy with
the Transvaal, both before and after the crisis was
decided. Truly times of adversity bring to light who
are friends and who are foes. The trouble of the Transvaal
during the first half of the year not only showed
the world her true strength, the true feelings of the
Burghers, the patriotism, love of liberty, the bravery and
magnanimity of the Afrikander race, but it also exploded
a long existing idea, viz., that the Boers are a half-savage,
bloodthirsty, and cruel race. For it was seen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
that when sentence of death was impartially, legally, and
rightfully passed on the enemies of the country and
liberties of its people, they, the Burghers, were the first
to petition their Government to be merciful.</p>

<span class="medium">MIJNHEER MEYER CLAIMS HIS HORSE, ONLY TO GIVE IT
UP AGAIN&mdash;THE SONG OF THE BOER</span></h3>

<p>During the last few chapters we have almost lost sight
of our hero’s daily life. But it must not be forgotten
that we are not writing a mere romance, but are recording
a narrative of real life, earnest and real. Nor
must it be forgotten or lost sight of, that the real object
of the work is to tell of the hopes of future national
existence, of the patriotism and love of people and country
of a young Afrikander brought up from his youth with
the idea that his race is struggling for a place amongst the
nations of the world, and that he must do all in his power
to further that object. Therefore, we have during the last
few chapters told of the struggles of his countrymen towards
that object, in which he so greatly sympathised,
and of his thoughts and opinions on those struggles.
We have been simply recording his thoughts, his joys
for victories won and troubles overcome and avoided by
his race. The story of his country is his own story.
We shall resume the thread of his own life where we left
it off, having brought the political question of the day
that so much interested him up to date. After Steve
had sent off the telegram to his mother informing her
that Johannesburg had surrendered, he thought he could
do no better than to take his horse (or rather Mijnheer
Meyer’s horse) out for a little exercise, especially as the
horse had been having a good rest, and had been well
fed since his arrival at Pretoria. While Steve was riding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
proudly along the streets of Pretoria on the beautiful
stallion, the thought which had troubled him before reoccurred
to him again. How was he going to return the
horse to its owner? He had made inquiries as to the
whereabouts of Mijnheer Meyer, but owing to his speedy
departure from Krugersdorp with the prisoners of war,
he had been unable to find the gentleman in question,
as the commando with which Mijnheer Meyer served
remained in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Suddenly Steve heard an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>‘<i>Alle magty Kerel</i>, where did you get that horse?’</p>

<p>Steve saw that this question was addressed to him,
and he also felt that it was a most awkward question to
be asked. He could not answer the question, so he
asked another.</p>

<p>‘Why do you ask, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Because it seems to me I know the horse,’ was the
reply of the man, who was a fine-looking, good-natured,
elderly man. At his side walked a stalwart, broad-shouldered
young man, who seemed strong enough to
fell any ox with a blow of his hard fist. This young
man seemed to gaze on the horse with great interest.</p>

<p>‘Sir, if you know the horse, you can perhaps tell me
where I can find its owner, as I wish to return him his
property,’ said Steve.</p>

<p>‘Well, you won’t have far to go to find his owner, for
here is the owner himself,’ said the old man, pointing to
his companion, who it was apparent at first sight must
be his son.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you will allow me to ask your name, sir?’
said Steve, suspiciously.</p>

<p>‘I am Meyer,’ was the reply.</p>

<p>Steve did not answer until he had dismounted, when
he walked up to the young man with the reins on his
arm, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Mijnheer Meyer, I hope you will forgive me, but I
came in possession of your horse under most peculiar
circumstances; I trust you will accept my explanation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
and allow me to pay for the use of your horse, and any
other reasonable expense incurred, or to be incurred.’
And Steve told in a few words how he had come in
possession of the horse.</p>

<p>The old man and his son did not say much, but asked
Steve if he had been in time to see any of the fighting;
to which Steve replied by telling them that he had taken
part in the fight at Doornkop.</p>

<p>‘Can you prove this?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, easily; as it happens that the field-cornet
under whom I served is near by, if you will take a short
walk with me I will take you to him.’ This was done in
silence. Steve introduced Mijnheer Meyer to the field-cornet,
and at the request of the former left them together.</p>

<p>After ten minutes’ talk to the field-cornet and a short
conference between the old man and his son, they walked
up to Steve, when the old man took Steve by the hand,
and warmly shaking it, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Mijnheer Joubert, my son feels happy that his horse
should have served to bring such a brave young fellow
to the assistance of his country. Your field-cornet has
told me how bravely you fought at Doornkop, and we
have had a letter from my daughter in which she told me
how, and why, she had lent you the horse. You have
done well, and my son thinks you have taken such good
care of the horse, judging by appearances, and that you
ride him so well, that he wishes you to keep him as a
remembrance of Doornkop.’</p>

<p>‘But, sir, that would be too much kindness on his part,
much as I have learnt to love the noble animal. I cannot
consent to rob him of the best horse in Pretoria.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind, he shall not lose by it: I shall see to
that; I have one as good as this, which he shall have,’
replied the old man, in a way which showed Steve that
to refuse would be taken as an insult.</p>

<p>‘I accept your kind offer on one condition,’ replied
Steve, turning to the smiling young man, ‘and that is,
that you will accept this little offer in token of my gratitude,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
and he took off his only extravagance&mdash;his gold
watch and chain&mdash;and handed it to the young man, who
received it as graciously as he had given his horse.</p>

<p>Steve was indeed glad to be the owner of the beautiful
horse, all the more so as he had learned to love the
animal that had borne him so enduringly and so swiftly,
and had given him his heart’s desire&mdash;the opportunity to
strike a blow for his country.</p>

<p>Mijnheer Meyer and his son stayed for a week in
Pretoria, during which they and Steve were almost inseparable,
as a great friendship had arisen between the
young men, and the old man had learned to love Steve
as a son.</p>

<p>But soon the order came for all Burghers to return
home: amongst others, Mijnheer Meyer and his son&mdash;as
only a guard of a few score Burghers was to be retained
for a little while longer; and a temporary parting
came for the new-found friends.</p>

<p>I can conclude this chapter in no more fitting way
than by quoting here&mdash;</p>

<h3 id="CHAP_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="medium">IN THE MIDST OF LIFE WE ARE IN DEATH</span></h3>

<p>After peace was once more partially restored, our hero
resolved to pay Johannesburg a visit and see how the
<i>City of Gold</i> looked after its effort to amuse itself, <i>à la</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
South America, with an abortive revolution. It was not
until Tuesday, the 18th February, that he was able to
carry out his resolve&mdash;the evening of which day found
him comfortably dining at a leading Rand hotel.</p>

<p>Steve found excitement, although cooled to a great
extent, still running high. Arguments, pro and con,
on late events were still the chief, if not the only, conversation
indulged in during leisure moments.</p>

<p>It was after dinner, in the smoking-room, that our hero
found himself in the midst of a party of men hotly discussing
politics. The conversation was led by a colonial,
who was taking the part of the Government, and a Jingo
of the first water, who was as hotly defending the freebooters
and rebels.</p>

<p>‘It is no use talking,’ said the latter, who was
burdened with the name of Bock; ‘the Boers will
ultimately have to go under. They are in the minority;
they are illiterate; they are only half civilised! They
are <i>Boors</i>, and it is presumptuous to hold that they will
continue to rule this country&mdash;still less that they will
ever rule South Africa! Englishmen are bound to <i>chuck</i>
them out in the end.’</p>

<p>‘Anyone can see that you are using the hackneyed
arguments of the Jingoistic enemies of the Government,
and that you are not speaking from your own knowledge
or experience, but from what you have read in Jingo
papers. It is true the Boers are illiterate, or the majority
of them are; but it is also true that those few who
have had the benefit of education have proved that the
Afrikander is as capable to learn, and as susceptible to
education, as any race in the world. As to civilisation&mdash;they
are more civilised, as civilisation is taught in the
Christian code, than many of their European contemporaries.’</p>

<p>‘If you call Bible reading and psalm singing, civilisation,
I won’t argue the matter with you; in any case,
they are bound to bend before the English race, sooner
or later.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>‘By your faith shall ye be saved!’ interposed Steve.</p>

<p>‘By which you mean, sir?’ inquired Bock.</p>

<p>‘I mean that the Boers do not believe that salvation
lies in superior learning, in high civilisation, or in
superiority of numbers or arms, but in right and justice
and the blessing of God?’</p>

<p>‘Cant!’ was the sneering reply of Bock.</p>

<p>‘You may call it <i>cant</i> if you like. But it was such <i>cant</i>
that gave Dingaan and his twelve thousand warriors into
the hands of five hundred Boers. It was such cant that
enabled the Boers to carry on the war of independence
against mighty England to a successful issue. It was such
<i>cant</i> that brought the elaborate plots of Rhodes, Jameson
and the Johannesburg revolutionists to utter failure.
It will be such cant that will make South Africa a free
and united Republic, in which all the races of the world
shall live free and united! The Boers believe in the
efficacy of prayer: they believe that by prayer and
through faith they can move mountains, and&mdash;England
itself.’</p>

<p>‘Bah! do you believe in such nonsense? Do you
really believe that you have only to ask God, if God
there be, for anything you want, from a needle to an
anchor, to receive it?’</p>

<p>‘I certainly believe that God <i>is</i>, and that if we ask
we shall receive, if it be good for us, and if we ask in
faith. I also believe that blasphemy and unbelief shall
be punished,’ said Steve, reprovingly.</p>

<p>‘Rot!’ was the irreverent reply of Bock. ‘I do not
believe that there is such a thing as God, beyond the
godliness there is in Nature. There is no such thing as
a God that answers prayer, or punishes blasphemy.’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry for you,’ was Steve’s gentle reply; ‘for
the day shall come when you shall <i>know</i> that there is a
God of Wrath, who punishes blasphemy as well as a
God of Love, who answers prayer.’</p>

<p>Bock answered with a roaring and mocking laugh, and
said, ‘Well, I shall prove to you that there is no such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
God as you worship. <i>If there be a God, Who punishes
blasphemy, I call upon Him to strike me dead, now or
within forty-eight hours.</i> There, I have thrown the
gauntlet down, let your God pick it up. I have given
Him time enough to do it in.’</p>

<p>Steve answered by jumping up from his seat and running
towards the door, where he stood looking at Bock
with terror in his face.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter with you now?’ inquired Bock,
laughing.</p>

<p>‘I fear me that God may take you at your word, and
in your doom include me, for being in such evil company.
For your soul’s sake speak not thus, but at least
treat your Maker with reverence.’</p>

<p>Even the others present were shocked at Bock’s blasphemy,
and seemed to share the fear of Steve to be
punished for being in the same room with such a
tempter of God; for they now rose and strolled out of
the room, leaving Bock alone.</p>

<p>The following day Steve went for a long and extended
stroll. He was surprised to see&mdash;all considered&mdash;the
bustle and life still to be seen in the streets of Johannesburg;
and he could hardly believe that he was walking
in a city whose revolutionary state, a few weeks previously,
was the talk of the world. He had no doubt that business
men and the mining interest were still feeling the
effects of the crisis severely; but the crowds in the
streets seemed to hurry and bustle, with the usual intentness
in their own missions in life incident to a large
and busy city.</p>

<p>Steve had lunch at some restaurant, and then journeyed
towards Auckland Park; and after a lengthy stroll about,
was thinking of returning, and hailed a passing cab to do
so, when he felt the earth tremble under him, and
the glass of a house opposite fell crashing to the
ground, and a noise as of distant thunder or artillery was
heard.</p>

<p>‘Is it an earthquake, or Johannesburg fighting in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
earnest at last?’ Steve asked himself. He jumped into
the cab, and told the driver to drive his best. A cloud
of smoke was now seen ascending the sky; and after a
few minutes a party in a cab was hailed and asked for
information, as they seemed to be coming from the
direction of the smoke. The driver replied that he ‘expected
some magazine had blown up, as a stone had
fallen from the sky a few yards from his cab.’</p>

<p>On reaching town, Steve was informed that a
tremendous explosion of dynamite had taken place
at Vrededorp. Evidence of the severity of the
explosion was not wanting, as everywhere smashed
windows were seen, and on nearing the scene
of the explosion, the signs of damage done increased
at every pace. All along the road our hero’s
heart bled to see the number of wounded being conveyed
to the hospital. But, on approaching the scene of the
catastrophe itself, Steve felt sick and faint at the signs of
death about him. He got out of the cab, and told the
driver to put the cab at the service of the wounded, and
look to him for payment when done. He himself assisted
to place two of the wounded on his cab, and forgetting
his natural repulsion at the sight of human blood and
gaping wounds, set to work assisting in the labour of
rescue.</p>

<p>‘My God! it is too horrible,’ he murmured, as
he saw a severed head lying alone and ghastly here, with ·
set and staring eyes. It reminded him of his thoughts,
in times past, of what the day of doom must be like. It
seemed to him, as he found a human arm here, a leg,
a hand, a head, or some portion of a body, there, that
these portions of human bodies were waiting to be
re-united to their other parts. He ran about, as if in a
fever, and as if he would avoid seeing these terrible emblems
of death lying about. Spade in hand, he would
now assist in following a limb protruding from the mass
of debris, lying on the brink of the vast hole that had
been made by the explosion, after which task had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
done, he would rush down to the bottom of the hole
itself, and there again work and dig till the sweat poured
from his face. After he could find no more rescue work
here to be done, (so many others being busy in the
same task that there was hardly room for all), he rushed
towards the many fallen houses, fallen upon the
inmates, where there was work enough for all. Oh,
what a sight! A sight, once seen, never to be forgotten,
if you live for a thousand years! Here is lying a dead
mother, clasping her dead child to her cold breast.
Here are a mother and three children, all found dead
in one room. Here is a father, mad because of his
grief, holding his dead child in his arms while moaning
over his dead wife&mdash;dead, all dead&mdash;<i>death</i> here, <i>death</i>
there, <small>DEATH</small> everywhere! How the men worked!
Affliction makes us all of a kin. Not one skulked.
Everyone was doing his best to rescue the wounded
from the wrecks of once happy homes. No thought of
politics here; no racial distinctions thought of. Here,
in this great affliction all were of one race&mdash;the human
race. Dutch and English work together like brothers.
An Englishman rescues and handles a child of Dutch
parents as tenderly as if it were his own. A Dutchman
pulls out of the ruins a ‘rooinek,’ and supports his head
as tenderly as if it was his own father, while he holds
the restoring cup to his lips. When God wishes our
hearts to be softened towards each other, he sends us
affliction.</p>

<p>While the work of rescue is still going on, others,
moved with pity at the sight of homeless and friendless
ones not killed or wounded, begin to subscribe of their
plenty, so that these may be provided for&mdash;a movement
that was responded to most liberally from all South Africa,
so that, at least, those who were left behind were provided
for. Steve worked hard as long as he could, but at midnight
he gave place to fresh ones who came up, as he
was now thoroughly knocked up, and went to his hotel
to get a few hours rest.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<span class="medium">THERE IS MERCY, EVEN AT THE ELEVENTH
HOUR, IF YE REPENT</span></h3>

<p>Early next morning, at five o’clock, Steve was again at
the scene of disaster. Gangs of men were still busy
looking for dead and wounded.</p>

<p>Steve was told that the hospital was full to overflowing,
and that the Wanderers’ Hall had also been formed
into a temporary hospital, and was also nearly full of
wounded. As Steve was walking from one ruin to another,
seeking for likely places where aid may be required,
he came to a mass of ruins. As he stood, looking
thoughtfully and sadly at a home, only one day before
tenanted by, perhaps, a happy family, now lying in a heap
of debris, its inmates no one knows where&mdash;perhaps sick
and wounded to death&mdash;perhaps <i>dead!</i> he heard a
moan of despair.</p>

<p>‘Who is there?’</p>

<p>Only another mournful moan for a reply.</p>

<p>Steve walked towards the sound, and came to a dog&mdash;a
mongrel, wounded and crippled.</p>

<p>He was moved to pity to see the look of entreaty,
almost human, in the eyes of the dog. It seemed to ask
his aid. Steve lifted the dog tenderly, and carried it to
a pool of water near by. But the dog would not drink,
it only whined, and, wagging its tail, crawled back to the
spot where found, looking still, with its entreating eyes,
towards Steve. Steve was puzzled at its action, and
followed it back to the spot. The dog gave a few feeble
scratches at the debris on which it lay. A beam of
mental light seemed almost to dazzle Steve, as it occurred
to him that the dog wanted him to search for some loved
master or mistress. He lost not a moment to begin, and
further aid soon coming up, ere long they succeeded in laying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
open what seemed to be the ruins of a dining-room.
Under a heavy beam they found a dead woman with a
spoon in her hand, having, apparently, been occupied in
feeding a child of about six months, who was lying, apparently
unhurt, under an arch formed by the falling
timbers. The child was sleeping, and, from the signs of
tears on its cheeks, Steve judged that it had cried itself
to sleep. Poor child! it had escaped by a miracle. Who
knows what work this child was born to accomplish?
When scores of strong men and women perished, this weak
babe of six months lived. God, apparently, has work for
it to do before it may die. Perhaps, when Steve is old
and trembling, this child, saved so miraculously, may be
accomplishing its destined work, and doing something
that shall benefit the whole human race, and causing
its name to be inscribed on the list of imperishable
names.</p>

<p>The joy of the dog seemed almost human when it saw
the wakened child, crowing as if nothing had happened.
Steve waited to see that the child was safely handed to
the care of a kind and motherly-looking woman, and then
returned to his hotel for breakfast. At breakfast Steve
learned, with pleasure, that the President and other
members of the Government were on their way to
Johannesburg to visit the scene of disaster. He resolved
to go to the station to see the arrival of the
Presidential party.</p>

<p>A great crowd was waiting at the station to welcome
the man, who, a little more than a month ago, would
have been hooted and jeered at, if not murdered, if he had
ventured to visit Johannesburg unattended, as he was
doing now. But the generous and humane actions of
the President, during the last month, had prepared the
way for the conciliation which was now to take place;
drawn towards each other, as both parties were, by
common sympathy at this moment of mutual loss and
suffering. Here, across the dead and wounded of
Burgher and Uitlander, the representatives of both parties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
shook hands, and forgot for the time, if not for ever,
their political differences.</p>

<p>The President and many of the most prominent
men of Pretoria, who were of the party, were driven
through the destroyed township. They then drove to
the improvised hospital at the Wanderers. The President
showed visible emotion as he viewed the many wounded.
The tears were seen to force their way down the face of
the man, who, in times of greatest danger, showed no fear
or emotion. But such is ever the way with great and
noble men. When danger threatens themselves, they
know no fear or pain; but when others suffer, they
know how to sympathise and feel for them.</p>

<p>With deep emotion, His Honour thanked the people
of Johannesburg for the sympathy and practical aid they
had given to the wounded, and promised that the Government
should not forget to do their share in succouring
the needy ones who had suffered loss of parents or
friends.</p>

<p>His Honour then reminded the suffering wounded that
there was a Great Physician on high, Who would heal all
their wounds, bodily and spiritually, if they would only
ask Him.</p>

<p>His Honour was presented by an address from the
Relief Committee, thanking him for the practical sympathy
shown to Johannesburg in this visit, to which the
President replied in suitable terms.</p>

<p>After a visit to the room upstairs, where some fifteen
orphaned children were housed, and some kindly words
of consolation and advice to the children, His Honour
visited the permanent hospital, which was also crowded
with wounded.</p>

<p>As Steve was following in the rear of the Presidential
party, his sleeve was pulled by one of the attendants, who
informed him that one of the wounded patients, who had
seen him passing, earnestly requested to speak to him.</p>

<p>Steve readily consented, wondering who of the wounded
could know him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>Following the attendant, Steve found himself before a
mattress, on which a man was lying, whose face was so
mutilated that he could not decide whether he knew the
man or not. He knelt down, and taking the hand of the
wounded man in his own, gently asked him what he
could do for him.</p>

<p>‘Do you not know me, Joubert?’ the man faintly
asked.</p>

<p>As Steve looked at him inquiringly, without seeming
to remember him, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Do you not remember Tuesday evening?’</p>

<p>The voice of the man, faint as it was, seemed now to
recall to Steve the scene of two evenings before, when
a mortal man denied the existence of his Maker, and
dared God to strike him dead, if indeed God there
was.</p>

<p>‘My God, hast thou indeed taken this man at his
word, and shown sinful man Thy might? Bock, Bock,
why did you ever deny your God, and bring yourself to
this?’</p>

<p>‘Why, indeed? Joubert, for God’s sake, for the sake
of the God you worship, tell me what I must do to
escape from the wrath to come? You said truly there
is a God of Wrath as well as a God of love. Teach
me to escape the God of Wrath and find the God of Love,
before it is too late! for now I know that there is a
God of Wrath! He has found me indeed. Oh, God, it is
terrible&mdash;terrible! The darkness surrounds me. Give
me light? Give me light?’</p>

<p>Steve was shocked and grieved inexpressibly at this
scene. He murmured a prayer for guidance how to aid
this erring soul.</p>

<p>‘Bock, old man, your sin was terrible. But God has
already shown you some of His great love; for it can only
be out of love and mercy that you were not killed outright,
and were given the opportunity to still live and
repent. If you truly repent, there is still mercy for you,
even now!’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, is there, is there? Oh, God, how can I know
that there is still grace for me?’</p>

<p>Steve motioned for the attendant to come to him, and
asked him if there was a Bible to be had. He was
handed a copy of the New Testament, which he opened,
and asked Bock if he might read him a chapter out of it,
to prove to him that there was still grace for him. The
poor wounded man gratefully accepted, and Steve read
to him the beautiful story of the repentant sinner on the
Cross, at the side of Jesus. Greedily the dying man
listened to this true story of the Cross, which he had
often heard and read in his youth, without appreciating
the wealth of mercy and hope there was in it. When he
heard the answer Jesus gave to the repentant sinner:
‘Soon shall ye enter with me into the kingdom of
Heaven,’ hope once more came to him, and a faint beam
of joy seemed to light up his wounded face.</p>

<p>When Steve had finished, he said gently to Bock,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Do you believe now that there is hope?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, oh, yes. Won’t you pray for me? God will hear
your prayer; you are so good to me.’</p>

<p>‘God loves to hear the sinner pray. We are all
sinners; I as well as you. I will pray; but you must
also pray.’</p>

<p>And Steve, kneeling as he was before the dying man,
lifted up his voice and prayed. His prayer began in
supplication, but, as he prayed, he seemed to feel that
God had already answered, for he ended his prayer in
thanksgiving, thanking God that another sinner had been
gathered to His fold.</p>

<p>When Steve opened his eyes he saw that a great
change had come over the face of the dying man. A
beautiful smile dwelt on the mutilated countenance of
the repented sinner, while a far-away look shone in his
eyes, as if he already saw beyond this world.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Joubert, thank you. God will reward
you. I thank thee, O Lord, that Thou hast heard me,
even now, and hast pardoned me my great sin. Hark!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
how beautifully they sing; surely ’tis angel voices sounding
so sweet. Ah! that is music indeed. What are
they singing? “Glory be to God and the Lamb, for
a sinner saved! Amen, Amen.”’</p>

<p>As he uttered the last word he seemed to fall gently
asleep&mdash;it was the last long sleep, from which he shall
only wake at the sound of the trumpet, calling him to
the judgment seat of the God he had denied in life,
but found in death.</p>

<p>Steve knelt long before the dead man in prayer, in
earnest thought. He could not help thinking how many
of those killed in this terrible disaster were as unprepared
to die as was this man; and how few of them had the
opportunity given them to repent before they died.</p>

<p>After a while, the nurse, finding a spare moment, came
to see how her patient was progressing. When she saw
that he was dead, she remarked to Steve that she was not
surprised, for the doctor had said that he could not live;
his injuries being too severe.</p>

<p>Steve asked if she knew anything of how Bock
happened to be in the accident. She replied that she
only knew what Bock himself had told her a few hours
previously, viz., that he had gone to the scene of the
accident on business. That it was the first time he had
ever gone in that direction. That he was standing at
the door of a tall building, inquiring his way, when
suddenly it seemed to him as if the earth was turning
upside down, and as if the house in front of him was
tumbling over on to him. That was all he remembered
until he came back to consciousness in the hospital.</p>

<p>After the funeral of the dead man was over, Steve took
the first train back to Pretoria, sad at heart at the scenes
of suffering and death he had witnessed.

<span class="medium">STEVE MEETS A SYMPATHETIC BRITISHER&mdash;A
RETROSPECT</span></h3>

<p>Another month went by. The political turmoil still
went on. Every day seemed to bring new probabilities
forth. One day peace seemed assured; the
following day some despatch, or public speech of the
British minister’s, seemed to threaten the Transvaal
with war. Meanwhile, the Government, with President
Kruger at its head, went steadily on, pursuing its
policy of conciliation and mercy, combined with great
firmness where its rights were concerned. But, in spite
of the many diplomatic victories gained by the Government,
and the sympathy shown towards it by all the
world, including many prominent British statesmen,
yet the attitude of the Imperial Government seemed
to be as if seeking a quarrel with the Transvaal.
Consequently, it is not to be wondered at that the
Transvaal Government was quietly preparing to defend
itself. Whispers went about of large quantities of arms
and ammunition being imported. Every field-cornet
had orders to see that his men were all properly armed
and ready to be called up, in case of need.</p>

<p>In the Free State the Government was giving full
attention to the question of fully arming every Burgher.
Even here President Kruger had won a great victory
without lifting a finger, for a new President had been
elected&mdash;a President heart and soul for the Afrikander
cause; a President working for a closer union of the
two Republics, which meant almost doubling the
strength of the Afrikander nation. What is more,
everyone felt that the Free State had a man for a
President who was thoroughly unselfish. A man whose
sole ambition seemed to be to live for land and people.
A man who would not hesitate to give up his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
ambition and position if it would benefit his country.
May he long be spared to his people. In Cape Colony
it was whispered that the Afrikanders were quietly arming
and preparing for the struggle, should it come; determined,
should the opportunity occur, to strike a blow for
liberty.</p>

<p>But England seemed to realise the volcano on which
she stood; the fire, which she would light, should she
unjustly attack the Transvaal&mdash;and&mdash;desisted.</p>

<p>Steve received an invitation one day from a prominent
townsman to a small dinner-party, to meet
some friends.</p>

<p>Steve was placed at table between a Scotchman and
an Englishman. After some conversation on general
topics, the Scotchman, who seemed to be a kindly,
genial old man, turned to Steve and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘It is so strange to me that I have met no Boers yet,
and here I am in the capital of the land of the Boers.
I have been six hours in Pretoria now, and during all
that time I have seen no one whom I could recognise
as a Boer from the descriptions I have heard and read
of them.’</p>

<p>Steve smiled and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘What is your conception of a Boer? By what description
would you recognise him?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I would easily recognise one if I were to see one.
Shall I describe to you what my idea of a Boer is,
from reading and hearing him described? Here you
are, then. I will begin from the top. Dirty slouch
hat; long, greasy, unkempt hair; tangled and untrimmed
beard; sly, crafty eyes; a sensual and unclean
mouth; dirty and unwashed face; dirty, baggy, ragged
clothing; if any shirt at all&mdash;dirty; if any shoes at all&mdash;made
of untanned leather. In short, a <i>Boer</i> is a man
uncivilised, untaught, untamed.’</p>

<p>This was said in such an innocent, inoffensive way
that Steve took no offence, but only laughed heartily,
as if at a good joke.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>‘Now, what are you laughing at? Do you mean to
say my description is not true? If so, then you must
blame those who have written the different descriptions
from which I have gathered my ideal of a Boer.’</p>

<p>‘Pardon me, sir; but are you the only stranger in
Jerusalem? Where are you from?’</p>

<p>‘I am from Glasgow, Scotland, at your service,’ was
the smiling and good-natured reply.</p>

<p>‘But how long have you been out of Glasgow?’</p>

<p>‘Not quite a month. I arrived here to-day, and I
came straight here.’</p>

<p>‘But surely, on your way from the coast, you must
have met many a Boer?’</p>

<p>‘No, I did not; but I suppose it is because I came
straight on to Pretoria after leaving the steamer.’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, you have a few things to learn yet, for I am
afraid you will have to journey far to meet your ideal of
a Boer. He does not exist.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I shall see. I suppose I will come across one
or more during my stay.’</p>

<p>Steve could not suppress another hearty laugh; but as
he saw that the kind-looking old man seemed hurt at his
mirth, he hastened to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Excuse me, sir; it amused me to hear you say that
you would recognise a Boer when you saw one, and
immediately after express a hope that you would see one
or more during your stay. Why, don’t you know that
half the guests round this table are what you call Boers,
or, rather, what we call them as a nation&mdash;Afrikanders?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I am&mdash;blessed! Do you mean they are born
Boers, or are they naturalised Uitlanders?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir; born and bred in the Transvaal or Cape
Colony. That one there was born in the Cape Colony;
this one to the left was born and grew up on a farm in
Waterberg; this gentleman just opposite us made his
living by farming, until he became a Government official;
that one to his right is an attorney, whose father was a
true old Boer of the old school.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>‘Well, who would have thought it! One never gets too
old to learn. It is lucky for me that they did not overhear
me.’</p>

<p>‘It would not matter if they did. We Afrikanders are
accustomed to be misunderstood and underrated.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by saying “<i>we Afrikanders</i>?”
Surely <i>you</i> are an Englishman; your speech betrays
you.’</p>

<p>‘I am as true an Afrikander as Oom Paul himself;
may I be as good a one as he is.’</p>

<p>‘You an Afrikander? <i>You</i> a Boer? Surely, sir, you
are trying to make fun of me?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir; we Afrikanders know how to respect our
elders. I mean what I say. I have never been out of
South Africa.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well, the world is full of deceit and lies! and
when I go back to Scotland I shall tell the people of our
country what a Boer really is. But this gives me just the
opportunity I wished for. I wanted so much to have a
talk with a Boer, but was afraid that I would not find
one who could understand me. I want you to give me
an idea of what the real feelings of your people are on
the situation in South Africa, and of the events of the
past few months. I came out to see and hear for myself
what the Transvaal and its people are like; and you, I
can see, are an educated man, and just the one to give
me the information I want. Are you willing to speak to
me on the subject?’</p>

<p>‘With the greatest of pleasure, sir. We ask for nothing
better than to be better known and better understood;
therefore I am willing to give you all the information you
want.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then, if you will be so kind, give me, in a few
words, the events which led up to the present situation.’</p>

<p>‘To begin from the very beginning: you know, sir,
that South Africa was first colonised by the Dutch.
To the Dutch was added a sprinkling, later on, of French
Huguenots, also a little seasoning of German blood.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
These three nationalities readily united, and formed a
sturdy race of hunters and farmers. A farmer in Dutch
is a <i>Boer</i>; hence the name Boer, which really means the
occupation and not the nationality of the race. Living
a life of seclusion and simplicity on their farms, the one
great characteristic of this people came to be their love
of their Bible and their love of freedom. This was bred
in them from their youth, and their faith is rather to die
than to lose either. When the English came, they would
or could in no wise understand or appreciate this race of
simple, quiet and peace-loving people. Their love of
peace was taken for cowardice. This at first led the
English to feel contempt for the Boers. This naturally
bred antagonism between the two races, which effectually
prevented any fusion of the two nationalities. Then, also,
the English wished to place the blacks on an equal footing
with the whites. This led to further antagonism; for
the Boers, while treating the blacks kindly and humanely,
do not believe that blacks and whites were intended to
be on an equal footing in this world. They contend
that even the Bible teaches that the children of Ham
shall be servants to the children of his brethren. In a
dispute on this matter, a Boer and some of his relatives
resisted the law, and were shot in the act, while several
others were hanged at <i>Slachtersnek</i> for the same offence.
This settled the matter. The Boers saw they were
the weakest; so they determined to leave their dearly-loved
country and seek for a land in the wilderness,
where they would be at rest, and the English cease from
troubling them.</p>

<p>‘The first country they took possession of in the interior
was what is now the Free State, and, soon after,
Natal was occupied. In both of these territories they
had to fight many a bloody battle with the fierce Zulus
and other native tribes before they could live at peace.
But no sooner were they settled, and had built homes
and ploughed lands, than once more England followed
them up, and forced them to ‘clear’ out after a short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
struggle. This happened in the Free State, as well as
Natal. The Boers now <i>trekked</i> in earnest to the Transvaal.</p>

<p>‘The Transvaal at this time was almost inaccessible to
an English army, because of the distance from the coast
in which it lay; therefore the Boers were not only able
to hold their own, but also to harass the English in the
neighbouring Colonies so as to force England to solemnly
recognise their independence at the Sand River Convention.
After the Sand River Convention, the Boers lived
at peace with England for many years. But they still
had to struggle on against native tribes, poverty, and the
internal dissensions usual to a nation in its infancy and
in course of formation. At last a time came when the
hardy Boers were sorely pressed, what with no market
for their produce, a President not in sympathy with their
simple ways and manners, and native wars. In the
meanwhile England, or rather certain Jingoistic Englishmen,
began to see what a mistake was made when
England allowed an independent state to grow up on the
borders of its own possessions in South Africa, the more
so as England had already been forced by avarice to do
an unjust act to the Free State, by forcing that independent
State to give up its most valuable possession&mdash;the
diamond fields&mdash;for a paltry consideration. And gold
having begun to be discovered in the Transvaal, it seemed
to be the best policy to take full possession of the Transvaal
before further discoveries of gold took place, which
might necessitate the same course of action which was
pursued in the case of the diamond fields. Besides, a
trick of that kind does not generally succeed twice; therefore
something new must be tried this time, and the best
plan would be to take possession of the whole country
on some pretext or other. When an excuse is sought
to do an unjust thing, such an excuse is easily found.
Now that the Boers were so hard pressed, what could be
more in conformity with England’s usual policy of succour
and protection of weak countries than relieving the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
Boers of any further trouble of forming their State on a
firm basis by annexing the Transvaal? This was done
in a manner unworthy the traditions of a country like
England.</p>

<p>‘Sir Theophilus Shepstone, England’s tool and emissary,
sent a letter to the Transvaal Government, in which he
requested a conference to discuss certain matters in
which the States and Colonies of South Africa were
alike interested, amongst which was the threatening attitude
of the natives in the Transvaal, stating, in a passing
sort of way, that he was bringing an escort of a few gentlemen
and twenty-five border policemen from Natal; and
as he was sure that there would be no objection to his
coming, he would not wait for a reply, but would start at
once.</p>

<p>‘Of course no reasonable objection could be made to
his coming, so he was received in a friendly manner.
What was the surprise of the Government when Sir
Theophilus, after a pretext of discussing matters, formally
annexed the land in the name of the Queen? Of course
protest was made, but no heed was given to it. What
were the Boers to do? They had no wish to fight
mighty England; so it was decided to try all peaceful
ways to endeavour to get their beloved country back.
Deputation after deputation was sent to England, praying
the Queen to give back their own. But it was all in
vain. England would not easily give up territory once
obtained.</p>

<p>‘At last, at a great meeting of the people, it was decided
to fight, and, if need be, <i>die</i>, for their independence.
War was declared. The result all the world knows.
The Boers fought bravely and fairly, and through God’s
blessing, the cause of justice was victorious. England,
after the loss of several battles, professed to see the
justice of the claims of the Boers at last. A truce was
called, and England promised to accede to the wishes of
the Transvaalers on terms to be decided at a convention
to be held at Pretoria. The Boers were disbanded and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
sent home rejoicing at having achieved their independence.
The convention was held. But alas for England’s
good name, now that the Boers had gone home and had
once more settled peaceably to their occupations, she
would not give up all she had taken. She had taken
the Transvaal as an entirely free and independent country.
Now, after her latest promises, she would not give back
more than a shadow of that former independence possessed
by the Transvaal. England must retain the
suzerainty of the country, with a right of veto on the
foreign policy of the country. The Boers loved peace.
They accepted these terms, hardly realising what a yoke
they placed upon their necks in so doing. After some
years it was seen that the country could not be <i>free</i> while
England retained the suzerainty of the Transvaal. The
British Government was approached on the subject. A
new convention was drawn up in 1884 and agreed to, by
which the suzerainty was withdrawn. Now came a time
of prosperity to the country. Gold was discovered in
various places. Wealth poured into the country. A
large population of Englishmen grew up in the gold-digging
centres. Once more an Ahab desired to possess the
vineyard of his neighbour. Not content with reaping the
fruits thereof, the Englishmen living on the goldfields
wished to have full possession of the whole country.
Agitation and conspiracy was rife. The result has been
seen in the events of the first few days of January of this
year. Although these events have been distorted shamefully,
yet you must know enough to glean the true facts
of the case from what you have heard.’</p>

<p>‘Although you have put it in a very few words, yet you
have put it so plainly that you have enlightened me on
many points which were dark to me before. Past events,
as stated by you, make the crime against your country
even blacker than it appeared to be before. But what
about the complaints of ill treatment and oppression laid
by the Uitlanders against your Government?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that is easily disproved. But I see signs of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
company dispersing. I am afraid we have paid our host
and his guests a poor compliment by keeping our conversation
all to ourselves. But if you will do me the
honour to come to my quarters to-morrow evening and
have a cup of tea or something stronger, if you prefer,
with me, then I shall show you a very capable article
from some English paper, which was taken over from the
paper in question by <i>The Press</i>. This article, by facts
and figures, disproves the Uitlander grievances much
more capably than I could do offhand. What do you
say?’</p>

<p>‘With pleasure. I should like nothing better than to
continue our conversation when we have more leisure.
You may expect me. At what hour shall we say? Will
seven o’clock do?’</p>

<p>‘Finely; that is settled then.’</p>

<p>After this the conversation on politics was dropped,
and Steve and his new acquaintance joined in the general
conversation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span class="medium">A LOOK INTO THE FUTURE</span></h3>

<p>The following evening found Steve’s new acquaintance,
true to his promise, seated at a table with our hero, partaking
of a cup of tea and biscuits. After tea, Steve
brought forth a box of his favourite Dutch cigars. The
genial old Scotchman did not wait long to press Steve
to continue their conversation of the night before, which
seemed greatly to interest him. So, both being comfortably
seated in a couple of easy-chairs, Steve proceeded
to read the cutting of which he had spoken the night
before, and we shall make no apology for reproducing it,
as it will prove of interest to those readers who have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
heard of the <i>Uitlander</i> grievances (?) but have never heard
the other side of the matter.</p>

<p>As you will see, it is a letter written to the editor of the
<i>London Daily Chronicle</i> and taken over by the <i>Pretoria
Press</i>. This is it:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘The following important and timely communication on
Transvaal affairs has been addressed to the editor of the
London <i>Daily Chronicle</i> and appears in the leading
journal under date the 1st inst: When the <i>Times</i> in
one and the same issue, that of the 27th inst., publishes
among the telegrams that most remarkable letter from
Mr Schreiner, late Attorney-General to the Cape Colony
under Mr Rhodes, on the cause of the attempted
rebellion at Johannesburg, and publishes under the
head of “The Colonies,” the statement that it was “the
intolerably bad administration of President Kruger’s
Government,” I think it is the duty of those who know
what they are writing about to set the public at rest as
to what were and what were not the real causes.</p>

<p>‘For the <i>Times</i> it should have been enough that the</p>

<h4>FIRM AND ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRER</h4>

<p>and follower of Mr Cecil Rhodes, his trusted Attorney-General
in two Administrations, distinctly and almost
brutally, three weeks after the rebellion, when in possession
of all the facts&mdash;facts which we shall know in all their
detail in three weeks time&mdash;declares the rebellion to have
been “due to a body of commercial speculators, the
machinations of the Chartered Company, to a minute
but powerful body of speculators in concert with financial
plotters outside,” and much more to the same purpose.
Mr Schreiner has nothing to say about the intolerably
bad administration of President Kruger having been the
cause, and he would not have been slow to put this reason
forward if he in conscience could have done so. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<h4>THE MANIFESTO OF MR CHARLES LEONARD</h4>

<p>says so. Yes, and it is about the manifesto that I wish
to set the public right once and for all; and my claim to
write on this subject is not to be disputed, as the oldest
continual resident at Johannesburg, from its very inception
until six months ago, intimately conversant with
men and with measures during the whole of that period.
There is no doubt much to be blamed in the past and
much to be improved in the future. I am not a defender
of the Kruger <i>régime à outrance</i>; but the faults that have
been committed and the omissions that are laid to its
charge are the natural consequence of the rapid and</p>

<h4>VIOLENT TRANSITION</h4>

<p>from a State devoted to pastoral pursuits to the most
intense mining and industrial pursuits, invaded by the
plutocracy. But neither the faults nor the omissions are
such as to have at any time, or in any country, justified
even armed resistance.</p>

<p>‘Never was the like of such a manifesto put forward
as a justification of rebellion, and the length of it&mdash;four
closely-printed newspaper columns&mdash;is in itself its condemnation.
If the leaders had a cause, the justice of
which required such wordy explanations, they had no
just cause to put before their followers. In the most
serious charges, the misappropriation of Government
moneys, we have terms like “it is stated,” “it is said,”
“we hear,” “we believe,” and scandal which was</p>

<h4>FORGOTTEN SEVEN YEARS AGO</h4>

<p>is raked up to justify recent events.</p>

<p>‘The reasons brought forward in the lengthy manifesto
can be conveniently divided under two heads&mdash;material
ones; corruption, mal-administration, and the fiscal policy
strangling the mining industry; and political: one is the
government of the country by a small faction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
Hollanders, the language grievance, the educational
grievance, and the franchise grievance.</p>

<p>‘To begin with the first section. I cannot deny that
the enormous temptations held out to some subordinate
officials by men who, having in an incredibly short time
acquired immense wealth, and who drowned every
scruple in their desire to increase the same, have
caused these men to fall; but from intimate knowledge
I deny that corruption in the Transvaal</p>

<h4>EXTENDS TO THE HIGHEST OFFICIALS</h4>

<p>or to any appreciable number of officials. I ask, however,
Mr Editor, whether the financial system which has
brought corruption in its train into the Transvaal can be
allowed in its turn to appeal to English sympathy and to
put forward this corruption as a justification for placing
the lives of thousands of peaceable men, women and
children to the hazard of the sword? If Pretoria has
been tempted, it is Johannesburg which has held out the
tempting hand.</p>

<p>‘The next point is, that the Government by granting
concessions and monopolies, and by its fiscal policy, is
endeavouring to strangle the mining industry. Now, it
is a fact, though perhaps a curious one, that most of
these</p>

<h4>CONCESSIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED</h4>

<p>to the Ecksteins, the Neumanns, and their friends; and
that, although these interests have often been clever
enough to obtain them ostensibly in some other name,
they actually hold the largest interest in them, viz., the
water and lighting concessions in Pretoria, the tram concession
in Johannesburg, the cement, iron, National
Bank and Mint concessions in Pretoria. These same
interests advanced the Government a few years ago
£50,000 for the object of purchasing Swaziland concessions.
It was stipulated by them that these moneys
should be repaid as soon as Swaziland was incorporated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
with the Transvaal, and that as a bonus they should receive
the water, lighting, and tram concessions in all the
principal towns in the Transvaal. The</p>

<h4>DYNAMITE CONCESSIONS<br /></h4>

<p>is the next point of attack, and even in this they had a
share. The statement is made, that this Government
monopoly imposes upon the mining industry an intolerable
burden, insomuch as the Government having the
right to charge 90s. a case for dynamite, it can be
supplied at 30s. I go into the figures of this business,
because there is here a concrete case, from which your
readers can judge for themselves the credibility of other
statements in the manifesto. The Government does
not charge 90s. but 85s. per case, and I cannot give
a more convincing proof that it cannot be supplied at
30s., than the fact that the De Beers Company, a powerful
financial and monopolistic company, where there is
no charge incurred for storage, distribution <i>del credere</i>,
etc., pays more than 60s. per case delivered in Kimberley.</p>

<p>‘Add to that price&mdash;Additional railage to Johannesburg,
storage, distribution over an area of forty miles of
reef and over a hundred companies, <i>del credere</i> and
collection commission, besides some import</p>

<h4>DUES TO THE TRANSVAAL,<br /></h4>

<p>and it becomes clear what use has been made of the
Government monopoly in powder and explosives for
purposes of agitation. To give an even more graphic
illustration. I extract from the last annual report of the
Crown Reef Company (the only company in which
the use of explosives is separately accounted for), the
fact that out of a total working cost of 30s. 2-3/8d. per
ton, the actual cost of all explosives was 1s. 2½d. per ton;
the unbearable burden justifying revolution!</p>

<p>‘Now, as to the other taxation said to strangle the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
mines. There is no country in which the personal taxes
are lighter. I challenge anyone, be he the richest or
poorest, to show me that he pays more than £5 per
annum of personal taxes in the Transvaal. And as for
direct taxes levied on the mines, I just extract from the</p>

<h4>LAST ANNUAL REPORT<br /></h4>

<p>to hand the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Crown Reef Gold Mining Company produced last
year in gold £420,106, 19s. 6d., has distributed last year
in profits £96,912, 2s. 5d., has paid to the Government
for rents, licences, and all other rights and privileges last
year £1191, 9s. 10d.</p>

<p>‘Robinson Gold Mining Company produced last year
in gold £651,928, 5s. 3d., has distributed last year in
profits £346,628, 12s. 6d., has paid to the Government
for rents, rates, and licences £395, 11s. 8d.</p>

<p>‘New Chimes Gold Mining Company produced
£93,013, 15s. 11d.; paid profits, £32,485, 16s. 3d.; paid
rates and licences, lumped in the balance-sheet together
with insurance premiums, £664, 16s. 5d.</p>

<p>‘The Transvaal Coal Trust produced 266,945 tons of
coal last year; all Government taxation amounted to
£53, 1s.</p>

<p>‘The Consolidated Land and Exploration Company,
of which the Ecksteins are the largest holders, owns over
250 farms of about 6000 acres each; all the taxes, including
absentee tax, amounted to £722, 2s. 6d. last
year.</p>

<p>‘Now for the</p>

<h4>INDIRECT TAXATION.<br /></h4>

<p>All machinery for mining purposes is subject to only 1½
per cent. import dues; the term machinery is stretched
by the Government to its uttermost possibilities to meet
the mining industry, and it is made to include f.i. sheet
lead, cyanide, etc. All other articles not specially rated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
are subject to an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 7½ per cent., the
Cape Colonists pay an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 12 per cent.
Specially rated articles affecting the white miners, such
as tea, coffee, butter, rice, soap, sugar, are in most cases
subject to lower, and in no instance to higher, duties
than in the Cape Colony, f.i.</p>

<h4>THE PRINCIPAL FOOD<br /></h4>

<p>of the Kaffirs, pays in the Cape Colony 2s. per 100 lb.,
and in the Transvaal 2s. per 100. Periodically, through
droughts, locusts, or other causes, prices for this commodity
rise rapidly, often from 10s. 6d. to 26s. 6d. per
bag, variations which are only slightly affected by the
import duty. Nevertheless, the Government has in
every instance of excessive prices abated the duty for the
time being.</p>

<p>‘The only other tax affecting the mining industry is
the Pass Money of 1s. per month per native; and the
moneys resulting therefrom are handed by the Government
to the Johannesburg Hospital, an excellent institution,
exclusively established for the use of Johannesburg

Government from the charge of endeavouring to strangle
the mining industry.</p>

<p>‘And now as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<h4>THE CHARGES CALLED POLITICAL,<br /></h4>

<p>Hollanders, I take it, are as much Uitlanders as is Mr
Phillips or any other Englishman; they have this one
advantage, that they speak the language of the country,
while 95 out of every 100 English in the Transvaal
decline to acquire it. But what are the facts? The
President and all the members of the Executive are
South African born, so is the Minister of Mines, so is
the Treasurer-General, the Auditor-General, the Postmaster,
the Surveyor-General, so is the Commandant-General,
the Chief of Police; so was, until three months
ago, the Attorney-General, so is the Mining Commissioner
of Johannesburg, and so are all the Landdrosts
(equal to your magistrates) throughout the country, with
one exception only. Of the judges of the High Court
two are South African born, two Hollanders, and one
Scotch.</p>

<p>‘The only other official of high standing who comes
from Holland is</p>

<h4>THE STATE SECRETARY,<br /></h4>

<p>Dr Leyds, and that he is an extremely able and distinguished
man his worst enemies will allow.</p>

<p>‘A census taken throughout the Civil Service has
shown that eighty-three per cent. are South African born,
and seventeen per cent. Uitlanders. Naturally, the
latter are selected from those who can speak the
language of the country.</p>

<p>‘Before I come to the other three grievances, I must
set right the grossly exaggerated figures which are given
in the English Press as affecting the population in the
Transvaal.</p>

<p>‘Mr Rhodes, in his cabled letter to the New York
<i>World</i>, gives them as 100,000 English against 14,000
Boers! Now the

<p>‘These figures, which are correct, make the absurdity
of the political claim clear, but more clear still if you
deduct from the 75,720 Uitlanders the 60,000 who dwell
at Johannesburg and its mining district; if you eliminate
that one town from the total, you have the Boers
numbering ten to one against the Uitlanders throughout
the country. And would you have a country ruled
in language, franchise and education by one mining
town.</p>

<p>‘To prove the correctness of the above statement you
have only to consider that there are on the</p>

<h4>MILITARY REGISTER<br /></h4>

<p>over 25,000 Boers. Every one of them is married, and
most of them have children, the average being over four
children, which gives the 150,000 souls.</p>

<p>‘Of these fully two-thirds do not understand English.
It is reasonable then to claim that the official language,
that official documents, shall be the language spoken by
two-thirds of the people, or do the women and children
count for nothing? But although the official language
by law is Dutch there is not a single Government office
in which there is not English or German spoken to those
who cannot speak Dutch. In the Courts in the witness-box
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
the judges frequently shut their eyes to the use of the
English language, and in the lower Courts English is
invariably spoken by English litigants.</p>

<p>‘Also as to the education the manifesto makes gross
misstatements. Though the State schools are, of course,
Dutch, and the ordinary State-aided schools are Dutch,
the</p>

<h4>GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS AGREED<br /></h4>

<p>to give to all English schools exactly the same aid as to
the latter, provided they will gradually, in the higher
classes, introduce the State language, so that in the
lowest classes only English is spoken, while in the
highest class Dutch is to be the medium. The Germans
in Johannesburg have and pay for their own
school, the English claim to have their schools, in
which, as Mr Lionel Phillips expressed it in his speech,
Dutch may be taught, perhaps, if there was a “little
time left,” maintained at Government expense.</p>

<p>‘And now to the last point, that of the franchise.
That a <i>settled</i> and <i>loyal</i> population cannot for ever be
refused a reasonable voting power I am the last to deny.
But is the Johannesburg population settled and loyal?
Can you wonder that the Boers have their grave doubts?
Where are all the men from the Transvaal who have
made their fortunes there? The Beits, Taylors, Neumann,
Bailey, the English, Barnato, Dunnings, and all
the others? Do they throw in their lot with the Transvaal?
Not at all; they live in London; spend their
money there, regard themselves as English, and do not
want to be anything. The very same men who now</p>

<h4>CLAMOUR WITH BAYONETS<br /></h4>

<p>fixed for the franchise, cover the addresses presented to
the High Commissioner when he comes into the Transvaal
with thousands of signatures as “Her Majesty’s
most loyal subjects.” Can you wonder at the Boer if
he cannot conceive the dual loyalty which claims to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
swear allegiance to the Transvaal without abandoning
that to England?</p>

<p>‘Can you wonder if he points to the doings of 1896 as
his justification for the refusal to grant the franchise
indiscriminately, points to the men who have called in
the enemy, the Chartered Company, into the country, and
under the dastardly pretext, too, that the Boer was
threatening to murder women and children, when the
Boers were quietly at their farms, while Johannesburg
had for the last six months been arming its thousands
of men with smuggled rifles and guns?</p>

<p>‘Can you seriously</p>

<h4>WONDER AT THE BOER,<br /></h4>

<p>who knows only one loyalty to his country, that of
leaving wife and child, plough and land, aye, and his
life, too, in the defence of the independence of his
beloved land? And are these qualities held so cheap
in this nineteenth century that stock-jobbers and adventurers
and their legal advisers may safely sneer at them
and find the approval of the great English nation? I
trust not.</p>

<p>After Steve had finished reading the extract, he sat
looking at his guest thoughtfully for a moment, who
seemed buried in thought. After a while, the visitor
turned to his host and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Are those facts given in that letter based on truth?’</p>

<p>‘Mainly so; the only fault is that he is too mild; he
could put it much stronger in favour of the Government,
without exaggeration.’</p>

<p>‘Humph, this is a different tale entirely from the
one told in Leonard’s manifesto; and from what I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
have seen and learned here, I am inclined to believe
this one in preference to the other one. But let
us take it for granted that this one is correct, and
leave the question of the past alone for a moment, I
want you to look into the future for a few moments,
and tell me what do you and your countrymen look
forward to as the probable future of South Africa?’</p>

<p>‘There are various views held. There are those who
wish for peace at any price, and who would be content
to leave matters as they are, viz., to keep what we have,
and let England keep what she has. But this will only
last while England allows us to peacefully keep possession
of our country. But, should England press us,
these would join the other party without a moment’s
hesitation.’</p>

<p>‘And what are the views of the other party?’</p>

<p>‘Well, it has never been defined. It is merely a
leaven permeating the thoughts, words and deeds of the
party. It is a strong patriotic feeling in the breast of
every true and thoughtful Afrikander, a desire to build
up a strong and united South African nation and a
strong and united South Africa.’</p>

<p>‘And how do you propose to bring this desirable
union to fruition?’</p>

<p>‘As far as I have been able to think it out, it can only
come to pass in two ways.’</p>

<p>‘And those two ways are?’</p>

<p>‘Either to fight for it, or to get it peacefully. If we
can get it peacefully, it would do England more good
than harm. England must have seen that the universal
desire of all South Africans of any merit, English or
Dutch, are tending towards Republicanism. It is true
that there has been a great deal of friction between
English and Dutch in the past, but the events of this
year have brought over nearly all of the English <i>South
African born</i> people of the colonies to the same view that
has all along been held by the Dutch, viz., that the
Imperial factor serves only to keep this friction alive,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
and that when South Africa is entirely free that this,
race hatred will die out, and that, instead of having, as
at present, an Imperial and a Republican party, we shall
only have the more desirable Liberal and Conservative
parties, both parties possessing Englishmen as well as
Dutchmen amongst their members. As I have said,
South African Englishmen have recognised this fact, and
all thoughtful South African Englishmen are beginning
to desire a Republican South Africa as much as the
Dutch. Now, if England is wise enough to recognise
this fact, and wise enough to act upon it in time, she
has only one thing to do, viz., to call a meeting, or
congress, of leading politicians from all the states and
colonies of South Africa. And this is what she should
propose:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘If I give up the whole of South Africa to you,
to form an entirely independent South Africa, will
you,</p>

<p>‘Firstly, give me the same commercial benefits I
now enjoy?</p>

<p>‘Secondly.&mdash;Will you give my ships, commercial as
well as ships of war, the same shelter and protection
as well as the same coaling facilities in times of peace or
war as now enjoyed by them?</p>

<p>‘Thirdly.&mdash;Will you enter in solemn treaty to be
England’s friends in both peace and war?</p>

<p>‘Fourthly.&mdash;Will you guarantee that you shall never
allow yourself to be annexed by any other power?</p>

<p>‘Fifthly.&mdash;Will you give me the most favoured nation
treaty in all respects, which would amount to England
enjoying the same benefits as now without any of the
responsibilities or worries she now has, and what would
South Africa reply to such a proposal?</p>

<p>‘They would be only too glad to obtain their independence
and freedom while remaining at peace with
and the friend of England, and they would accept with
joy?’</p>

<p>‘But should England refuse to give the whole of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
South Africa their freedom on these or any other
terms, what would then happen? Do you think that
you would deliberately fight for it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to say that the whole of, or any part
of, South Africa would rise up against England and
demand that she should vacate South Africa or&mdash;fight?’</p>

<p>‘No, these things do not happen in that way, as a
rule. It will simply happen that one of these days, in
the course of the petty persecutions against the two
Dutch representatives, which is always going on to a
greater or less extent, that the Republicans will put
their foot down and refuse to accede to some unjust
demand made on them by some Jingoistic British
minister, the consequence of which would be a war,
the end of which would be a united South African
Republic, with or without foreign aid. Either that
would happen, or&mdash;the utter extinction of the Boers.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think the last is at all likely to happen?’</p>

<p>‘If it is God’s will, <i>then</i> it will, otherwise not?’</p>

<p>‘Quite true! but from a worldly point of view, what
are the probabilities of the South Africans winning their
independence?’</p>

<p>‘A Joshua will arise, who will unite the different
races and peoples by a common sympathy. He will
cause the two contending parties or races to trust
him&mdash;he will form a link uniting the two together.
Once united with a common desire of Freedom and
Independence, and a leader worthy to be trusted by
all, the battle will be more than half won. With the
people of South Africa once united, they can resist any
army that England may send against them. England’s
power lies in her navy. The South Africans won’t
go to seek her on the sea to fight her. They will
simply wait for any and every army sent against them
on land, and by various means, which comes to those
fighting for liberty, will demolish those armies. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
will simply keep out of the way of the ironclads when
necessary, and keep on holding the land for years if need
be, until out of sheer weariness England shall grant them
peace. This is should they have no further aid than
their own people. But should one or more European
or American powers take up their cause, the end will
be sooner and more easily obtained.’</p>

<p>‘Would you or your Government then call in European
aid?’</p>

<p>‘I could not say what might or might not happen,
but I do not think it improbable that aid might come
unasked, and should we find ourselves hard pressed,
we might find ourselves simply forced to accept foreign
aid.’</p>

<p>‘And do you think there is really much chance of a
Joshua fulfilling the Herculean task of uniting the
various races of South Africa.’</p>

<p>‘It would not be such a Herculean task after all.
The thing is almost half done; the events of this year
have almost completed the task; it only wants the right
man to complete it entirely. What we want is a man
who would be trusted by all parties&mdash;a man who would
do everything unselfishly, who would leave <i>self</i> out of
the question entirely, and whose only desire would be
to advance the interest of <i>land</i> and <i>people</i>.’</p>

<p>‘And do you think there is any probability of such a
man being found?’</p>

<p>‘I have great hopes. The material for great and noble
men is plentiful in South Africa. I believe when the want
is felt for such a man by the people, the man will be
found.’</p>

<p>‘I can see you have thought much on the subject. If
you had the choice of the two means of obtaining your
independence, which would you choose?’</p>

<p>‘I would certainly choose the peaceful one. For then
the country would not receive the great check to progress
which she would receive after such a terrible war, as
would be the result in case we fought against England.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
Once we have obtained our independence by fighting for
it, our prestige as a people would be far greater than when
obtained by peaceful means. But besides the bloodshed
and material losses after such a war, we should for many
years have England for an enemy, and we would still have
a small party of Jingoistic Imperialists in the country.
While, should we obtain our independence peacefully, we
would have England for a friend and the Imperialist in
South Africa would not feel the bitter hatred against the
Republicans as was the case when the Transvaal had
obtained her independence after fighting for it. A hatred,
the evil effects of which are felt to this day.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you are quite right. I think, both for the sake of
South Africa and England, it would be far better if the
problem were solved peacefully. England would be no
worse off than she now is if she were to give up the country
on the terms proposed by you; while you would have
the satisfaction of being independent. As to the race
hatred felt after war, history has shown its evil effects&mdash;witness
France and Germany.’</p>

<p>‘And I do not see why this peaceful solution should not
be obtained. The only obstacle is the misrepresentation
of South Africans by parties interested. And then we have
people who declare that the Dutch in South Africa must
be extinguished, politically, at least, at any sacrifice, even
that of principle.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I understand. You refer to the Jameson Raid
and those concerned in it. But I hardly condemn the
raiders as much as I do those who approved it, who
should know better. I can tell you I feel ashamed of
being a Britisher when I read, for instance, Alfred Austin’s
poem. It is a shame that a man who implies such <i>want</i>
of principle should hold the position of Poet Laureate to
the British Crown.’</p>

<p>Steve smiled and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘That reminds me that I have another extract which I
would like to show you. It is a parody on Austin’s poem,
published by the Orange Free State <i>Express</i>.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<p>‘I should like to see it?’</p>

<p>‘It ought to be read together, so if you will allow me,
I will read you Austin’s poem first, and then the parody.

<p>Basterland, Feb. 1896.</p>

<p>After Steve had finished reading, the smiling and
laughter-loving Scotchman burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>‘Very good; very good indeed; ha, ha!’ he laughed.
‘I should like to see Austin’s face if he should read
this; ha, ha! It certainly has the merit of <i>truth</i> which
Austin’s poem lacks.’</p>

<p>After some further conversation Steve’s guest left him,
giving him a hearty invitation to dine with him the following
day.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3 id="CHAP_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<span class="medium">LOVE AT LAST</span></h3>

<p>We have endeavoured to keep romance and love stories
out of this book. We have nearly succeeded, but in order
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
to complete our work, we find that love will intrude itself,
if it is only in the last chapter. It is not our fault,
we have done our best, but our hero, like all other
heroes, has gone and done it. He fell in love. With
whom? Why, my dear reader, it cannot be difficult to
guess. We have not introduced many ladies into our
story. We have only introduced two who would or
could be a fit mate to our young friend. The first one
was the sister of the poor young fellow who was killed by
lightning. But we honestly declared, from the moment
of introducing her, that Steve was not going to fall in
love with her. So there is only one left. We have not
tried to deceive the reader in the least. When we knew
that Steve was not going to fall in love, we told the kind
and indulgent reader so honestly. We did not deceive
the reader, but Steve deceived us. He never told us
that he was going to fall in love. When we heard of it,
it was an accomplished fact. It happened in this way.
Steve got a fortnight’s holiday. What was he to do?
He thought for a moment, then jumped up and said
aloud, astonishing his friends who were with him at the
time.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I have it, a good idea!’</p>

<p>‘A good idea?’ queried Keith. ‘Where did you get
it from?’</p>

<p>‘Never mind; I am going to act up to it, too. I have
a standing invitation from the Mijnheer Meyer to pay
him a visit, and I think I cannot do better than give
Black Prince a sight of his old home again.’</p>

<p>There now, gentle reader, the cat is out of the
bag; you know now with whom Steve fell in love
surely.</p>

<p>And Steve did act up to his <i>idea</i>. He took Black
Prince to see his old home again. When he arrived at
the door of the well-appointed farmhouse, he did not
see anyone about. He dismounted and knocked at the
door. The door was opened by&mdash;no, not Miss Meyer,
but Jankie, the old Hottentot, who was Steve’s first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
acquaintance on the farm. <i>He</i> did not recognise
Steve.</p>

<p>‘Is the baas in?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir, but the young missus is in. The old baas and
the old missus have driven over to Baas Rautenbach’s
farm, but will be back this evening. The two young
baases are also out, but will be back to-morrow.’</p>

<p>Steve felt a little embarrassment when he heard that
only Miss Meyer was in. However, he decided to make
the best of it until the old man returned.</p>

<p>‘Tell the young <i>nooi</i> that I would like to see her.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. Will you come into the sitting-room? I
will tell the <i>nooi</i> that you are waiting there.’</p>

<p>Steve walked in, and had hardly sat down when he saw
a vision of beauty walk into the room, which surprised
him, as it was most unexpected. He had only seen Miss
Meyer before, when greatly agitated, and when the light
was faint and indistinct. Now that he saw her in the
bright daylight, he saw a young girl, with a sweet, smiling
face, in whose bright eyes shone the light of great intelligence;
she was tastefully but simply dressed. Her form
and face appeared to him simply perfect. Her long
light hair was hanging in a wavy mass down her shoulders,
while a halo of sunny tresses surrounded her glorious forehead.
But what pleased and attracted him most was the
<i>Soul</i> he saw shining through her expressive countenance.</p>

<p>‘Surely this is the sweetest creature that ever I saw,’
was the thought that flashed through his brain during
the moment that elapsed before she spoke. He was
standing with the light on his back. She came up and
tried to make out his face, but seemed puzzled.</p>

<p>‘Can I do anything for you, sir? My father is not in
now, but will return this afternoon. Shall I tell the
boy to put your horse in the stable?’</p>

<p>‘If you will be so kind, I shall be much obliged to you,
Miss Meyer. Poor creature, he is a bit tired; it is a
long time since I have ridden him so far,’ he said,
smiling.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span></p>

<p>As Steve spoke, she looked at him inquiringly, as if
she half recognised him but was afraid to make a mistake.
She turned to the door and told Jankie to take the horse
round to the stable, then came back and asked in the
usual Afrikander way,&mdash;</p>

<p>‘May I ask who you are, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you know me, Miss Meyer?’</p>

<p>‘I thought I did, but I am not quite sure. When I
look into your eyes and hear your voice, I am almost
sure I know you, but that beard confuses me. The one
I take you for had no beard when last I saw him.’</p>

<p>‘No, Miss Meyer, I had no beard then; but since that
day I have never shaved, because your mother thought
me an enemy because my face was shaved.’</p>

<p>‘So you really are&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I am the one that was in grief and despair, and to
whom an angel came and touched me on the shoulder
and said, “God has heard your prayer.” That angel
came in your form, and gave me the most beautiful
and best horse in the country, when I would have given
my all for the ugliest old moke to be had.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr Joubert, is it really you then? I thought it
was you the moment I saw you, but, as I said, the beard
confused me. I am so glad to see you again. My father
has long expected you, as he said you had promised to
pay us a visit. But don’t call me an angel again; I am
all flesh and blood, and prone to sin, and you will tempt
me to become proud if you thus flatter me, and pride is
sinful.’ And as she spoke the blood she spoke of flushed
rosily in her face, as if to prove her assertion of being
flesh and blood.</p>

<p>What need to say more. The thing was done. Each
felt drawn to each. Each felt that each had met a
kindred spirit, and each soon felt that each loved each
other; and when Jankie came in half-an-hour later to tell
his <i>Nonnie</i> that Master Willim’s black stallion had come
back, he found the two talking and smiling as if they had
known each other for years. When old Mijnheer Meyer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
came home, he gave Steve a princely welcome, and the
old lady, in spite of her former distrust of him, soon
learned to love him as a son; the more so as he had
grown a beard since last she had seen him. She detested
a man who shaved.</p>

<p>And when Master William came home, he gladly
renewed his former friendship with Steve, while his
younger brother rivalled him in his attentions to their
guest.</p>

<p>Before Steve’s holiday was over, everything had been
decided upon. They were to be married in a month’s
time. The month was to enable Steve to give his employers
a month’s notice to leave, as old Mijnheer Meyer
had given him and his betrothed the Pretoria farm belonging
to the family.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The wedding was over. Steve took his beautiful
young bride for a trip to his old home in G&mdash;&mdash;, to see
his mother and sisters. His mother was greatly pleased
that her son had taken such a good and beautiful young
wife.</p>

<p>As Steve received, as the wedding portion of his wife,
a farm, with house, furniture and everything complete,
and as his wife, like all daughters of well-to-do farmers,
possessed her own flock of sheep, her own little herd of
cows and bullocks, besides horses, etc., Steve found himself
a fairly well-to-do young farmer. He now felt
himself in the position to indulge to his heart’s content
in the pleasures of tree-planting, gardening, farming
and bee-keeping, which had always been his special
hobby.</p>

<p>With a good and beautiful wife, a well-stocked farm,
and by selling the greater portion of his mining shares&mdash;a
good capital to work his farm&mdash;Steve has every promise
of a happy and prosperous life before him. What his
future <i>will</i> be we cannot say. With his intense love of
country, he is sure to go in for politics, and with the freedom
he now enjoys as an independent farmer, he will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
have leisure enough to enter into the political arena. If
the opportunity offers, he is sure to do something for his
country yet, and the reader may yet hear of him again as
a leader of his people. We shall bid him and the reader
now good-bye.</p>

the conviction that such a book is needed, and secondly, that the
Author is possessed of the information required for its production. With
regard to the first of these:&mdash;The price of nearly all the standard works on
ornithology places them beyond the reach of the young naturalist, and
the information contained in the few cheap books, which at present exist, is
in many instances scanty. The aim of the Author has been to place in the
young collector’s hand, at a popular price, a comprehensive account of every

this work is that it is a compendium of the subject of Evolution, and in
itself a small theological encyclopædia made popular.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
